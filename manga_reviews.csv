0,['Berserk'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/2/Berserk,"[""Story - 9.38\n\r\nThe first three volumes may discourage some of the readers because it's starts off kind of slow and the initial artwork is not quite up to today's standards. However, after the reader begins the Golden Age arc it is nearly impossible to not be pulled in and become addicted to the series. It is chock-full of action, drama, character development, twists and turns, and just a dash of romance. It defies generalization and is just damn good storytelling.\n\r\nAfter the Gold Age arc wraps up the story come back full circle to where it left us at the end of volume 3. But by\n                  ...\nthen the rhythm of the manga has changed completely. The reader has established a deep connection with Guts, Casca, and Griffith and that only grows more as the story continues. You'll be confronted with conflicting emotions and think things like &quot;I really want to see Guts put Griffith in the ground&quot; and at the same time &quot;Griffith is just so damn cool&quot;. These conflicting thoughts and emotions just go to show how invested the reader becomes with the characters.\n\r\nAnother good thing about the Berserk story is that the protagonist (Guts) is not always the focal character in every chapter. In fact, nearly all of the major supporting cast members receive a considerable amount of page space for their own stories to be fleshed out. Each of these side-stories is not only unique and extremely well developed, but also very deep and revealing as it shows the reader why these character are the way they are. One of the side stories that I found most intriguing was Farnese and Serpico's as it was so beautifully orchestrated as part of the manga as a whole.\n\r\nThe only problem with the story, in my humble opinion, is the introduction of magic in the manga. I feel that the magic the group &quot;acquires&quot; in volume 24 is somewhat exaggerated and does not suit the dark atmosphere of the story. In fact, at times it can even make some of the chapters feel a bit shounen-esk. But even still, it's pretty much impossible not to enjoy the ongoing story that is Berserk.\n\n\n\r\nArt - 9.6\n\r\nThe artwork in the first few volumes of Berserk won't do much to impress many of today's manga readers, but at the time when the series was first serialized (1992) it was certainly well above average. Those initial volumes feature many very unique character designs (especially the apostles) and also sport a relatively high focus on detail. However, where Miura really shows off his latent artistic talents early on is through his ability to create crisp, clear, and highly fluid fight scenes.\n\r\nOne of the few negative aspects of the early volumes can be identified as the simple shading techniques that Miura used. Also, sometimes the character faces will look just a bit &quot;off&quot; and it can be a little distracting. However, these minor quality issues were most likely due to the time constraints that were in place at the time and not entirely the fault of the artist.\n\r\nThen as the series progresses the reader gets to watch the artwork literally evolve. As we learn more and more about the characters and the world in which they live, the characters themselves and their environments become more and more visually detailed. The simple shading from the early volumes is eventually replaced by a hand shading technique which gives the series a more gritty and surreal overall feeling. The character designs become more crisp and facial expressions sometimes are so vivid that one look at a character's face is often enough to tell the reader exactly what the character is thinking. By the time the reader makes it into volumes 20 and beyond Miura has made it very clear that he means for Berserk to be truly regarded as a work of art just as much as it is a masterfully epic piece of storytelling.\n\r\nIn my own experience I have seen very, very few other manga series that can even approach Berserk's later volumes on an artistic level and, unfortunately, I highly doubt that I will ever be able to find its peer.\n\n\n\r\nCharacters - 9.5\n\r\nThe very first character you will meet in Berserk is Guts, the &quot;Black Swordsman&quot; with a dark past and a score to settle with his demonic enemies. Certainly not a very revolutionary character at first glance, but even though he may start off as such, his character quickly expands, and ends up as one of the most believable and human characters I have ever witnessed.\n\r\nAs the story unwinds, you follow Guts through his past, allowing you to experience his personality change during his constant battle against fate. You follow Guts through waves of despair and hardships offset only by the flickering fires of friendship and trust. Eventually, Guts becomes like a maelstrom of opposing emotions, and the question arises, will he continue on his path of all-consuming revenge even if it means losing everything he has come to care for?\n\r\nThe other characters that appear throughout the course of the story come in all different shapes and sizes and all play their roles perfectly, just as support characters should. The more important support characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, are all draped in many layers of depth, making their characters both solid pillars and interesting ingredients within the plot as a whole. From Griffith's burning ambition to the skulduggery of the God Hand, from Puck and Isidro's antics to Farnese's troubled past and uncertain future, the characters all appear vivid and alive (Although alive might not fit The Skull Knight...) and all have their own emotions, personalities and ambitions. The supportive cast show their brilliance in how they appear to the reader as actual players in Berserk's grand game, and not just as passive plot devices.\n\r\nWith such a cast of strong personalities and vibrant, living characters, Berserk easily cuts it's way (no pun intended) to the top score in this category.\n\n\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\n\r\nThe fact that I sat and read through all 295 chapters of this exquisite manga in one sitting should justify the perfect score for enjoyment! The manga has great characters - heroes you root for and empathize with, villains you can't help but admire for their ruthlessness and charisma. The artwork is dark, brooding, and gruesome and complements the story well. And what a riveting story it is... It hooks you from the first chapter and sets the stage for the most intriguing revenge themed manga on the market. Its success is testament to its quality. My only complaint is the excruciating waits between chapters.\n\r\nAlso, I must throw in a cautionary note: this manga is quite definitely not for the faint hearted. There is a considerable amount nudity, sex, gore, violence, and, for the lack of a better word, bad-assery!\n\n\n\r\nOVERALL - 9.69\n\n\n\r\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the &quot;Critics and Connoisseurs&quot; club.

1,['JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 7: Steel Ball Run'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/1706/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_7__Steel_Ball_Run,"['Serving as a soft reset for Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, Steel Ball Run takes the story in original and daring directions. But does it work? Oh who am I kidding? I\'m going to be straight up. \r\nI consider Steel Ball Run to be one of the greatest written works I\'ve ever read. \n\r\nSTORY: 9/10 \r\nI will admit Steel Ball Run has a very, very slow start. In fact, Stands aren\'t even introduced until like 20 chapters in. That\'s another thing: Steel Ball Run is seinen instead of shounen. That means each chapter ranges from 35 to 60 pages long in comparison to the 20 page long\n                  ...\nchapters of the Jojo Parts before. This may seem daunting at first, but once you get invested in Steel Ball Run it feels like the story was too short, despite being the longest Jojo Part to date. Steel Ball Run also changes the Jojo formula in its fights. Stands are no longer humanoid for the most part, and they function more as superpowers than spirits who fight for you. Each fight is engaging and unique, dealing with psychological warfare more than throwing blind punches. This makes the fights in Steel Ball Run among the best in the series. \n\r\nSteel Ball Run is also magnificently written with very great story arcs throughout. However, there is a controversial near the very end direction which I won\'t spoil that will surely throw some people off and make them consider it unnecessary. Eh, I didn\'t mind it too much, though it does undermine what made a previous Part so good to a degree. Despite that, it still contains one of the greatest and most emotional endings I\'ve ever read.\n\r\nART: 10/10  \r\nPart 4 may have been the pinnacle of Araki\'s style, but Steel Ball Run is his pinnacle in his talent. Truly perfect art in all fields. The detail is much more in depth than previous Parts and character designs are on point. \n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10/10 \r\nSteel Ball Run, though its primary cast is a fraction of other Parts, contains some of the best characters in Jojo, and in my opinion some of the best characters of all time. Gyro Zeppeli qualifies for the latter. He\'s hilarious but he also has a tragic backstory that offers him plenty of motivation while keeping him in mystery. Diego Brando is an interesting spin on Dio Brando from The Phantom Blood and his Stand Scary Monsters is awesome. Lucy and Steven Steel are a great duo. Steven is barely in the story but he\'s a well written and unique supporting character and while Lucy doesn\'t really come into play until the finale she is still compelling. Wekapipo is one of the best side protagonists and works well as a foil to Gyro. Steel Ball Run also contains my favorite side villain, Ringo Roadaggin, and though his time spent in the story is brief it is arguably he pinnacle of Jojo. \n\r\nAs for the Jojo and main villain, they\'re simply the best. Johnny Joestar is a tragic lightning rod of Shakespearean proportions. It\'s not only impossible to not root for him, it is immoral. He has one of the greatest and most significant character arcs I\'ve ever experienced, and his Stand Tusk is awesome to boot. He is my favorite Jojo bar none, despite being one of the most depraved ones. Johnny is immoral and sinful and honestly can be considered the villain of Steel Ball Run, but he is still a compelling force of nature. \n\r\nThe villain, President Funny Valentine, in contrast, can be considered the hero to an extent, and is one of the most sympathetic villains to grace manga. In fact, it\'s no secret Funny Valentine is my favorite antagonist ever. He\'s like a better version of Ozymandias from Watchmen who takes pride in his actions rather than cry in secret. A true patriot, Funny Valentine will stop at nothing to make America great again. As said by the man himself, his ""heart and actions are utterly unclouded. They are those of JUSTICE."". His Stand, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (D4C), has one of the most insane and unique powers of any Stand and makes for a more than satisfying final fight. \n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10 \r\nSteel Ball Run blew me away in every way. It is a literal epic, a poetic work of great magnitude following flawed heroes on a large scale journey that tests their spiritual and emotional strength as well as their physical. It is compelling and powerful and the fights are pretty damn great. Absolutely mind blowing and awe inspiring yet will leave you in an emotional wreck, despite the story still being filled with trademark Araki humor (Thanks mostly to Gyro and his obsession with making up gags). Johnny and Gyro are a perfect tag team; their relationship is strong and real and their chemistry is on point. They are part of what makes the story so damn compelling. \n\r\nOVERALL: 9.75/10 \r\nSteel Ball Run is one of the most intense and pleasing emotional rollorcoasters I\'ve ever experienced. It contains some of my favorite characters in fiction history and is a fantastic new take on the Jojo universe that, dare I say, is utterly superior to all that\'s come before it. Featuring my favorite fights, my favorite Jojo, my favorite villain, my favorite story, and one of the most emotional endings I\'ve read, it\'s no secret that I consider Steel Ball Run to be the greatest Jojo Part, and one of the greatest manga ever created, period.']"
2,['Vagabond'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/656/Vagabond,"['Some seinen manga, I believe, take the meaning too far. The gore and nudity found in them is simply disturbing, no longer artistic, just omnipresent and absolutely in-your-face.\n\r\nVagabond is not like those seinen manga.\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Vagabond has this strange allure to it. Drawn to this manga by the promise of awesome fight scenes, [oh yes, I assure you, you will not be disappointed by the fight scenes], you find yourself hooked to this manga.\n\r\nAbsolutely, completely, utterly, hooked.\n\r\nIt starts off with a rather rude and yet beautiful jerk, depicting the scene of a battlefield in splendid watercolor. The manga just rides on from there, rising\n                  ...\nfrom peak to peak. The fights get better, and the character himself grows. He grows realistically, he stumbles, he falls, he falls so hard that he finds it difficult to get back onto his feet, he takes the wrong path, goes the wrong way, makes the wrong enemies, and kills the wrong people, but he gets back up, and the story continues.\n\r\nIt is just so completely believable, so persuasive and so artistic all at the same time that with this manga just feels so raw and yet so real.\n\r\nThe main character, who one will find it hard to identify with on the surface, has something deep within him that every single one of us can possibly understand and aspire towards. \n\r\nHis growth and development, in more ways than just of the sword, but yet at the same time never truly leaving the sword, are so simple and yet so spectacular at the same time. He manages to bring out the best in some people and the worst in others, brushing past some like a whirlwind and crashing headlong into others, leaving behind a trail of death, destruction, and new life. All this happens while he himself is still growing, and while he is nowhere near perfect, there is just something so addictive about getting to know more about him. \n\r\nAnd getting to know more about the main character is exactly what this entire manga is about. It is about seeing Miyamoto Musashi through the eyes of the world, through the eyes of others, and through his own eyes.\n\r\nWith a brilliant blend of flashbacks, flashforwards and glimpses into the lives of others besides those who surround the main character, Vagabond paints a rich picture of the samurai scene in the time of Miyamoto Musashi, the main character.\n\r\nIf you have been hesitating about reading a seinen manga, hesitate no more.\n\r\nVagabond will open your eyes to a brilliant new genre.']"
3,['One Piece'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/13/One_Piece,"['Frequently categorized with both Bleach and Naruto as one of the Shonen Big Three, One Piece is a romantic tale of pirates, treasures  ...talking reindeer, panties, flying skeletons, Takoyaki selling Octopuses, and oceans roaming with Sea Monsters the size of which can take down fleets of ships. Crazy enough for you? This is the world of One Piece.\n\r\nBeing categorized with Bleach and Naruto, on the surface this might strike an unfamiliar reader as another generic uncreative Shonen series; but truthfully, comparing One Piece to Bleach and Naruto would be like comparing Disney World to an elementary school playground. If these three series are the\n                  ...\nbig three, then One Piece would be the boss sitting on a lavish chair smoking a cigarette, while Bleach and Naruto would be the two henchmen standing side by side of the boss and nodding at everything he says. \n\r\nStory:\n\r\nSet during the Golden Age of Pirates, the story follows Monkey D Luffy as he sets sail with his crew to conquer the sea which is inhabited by formidable pirates who all aim to become the Pirate King, the Grand Line and claim the treasures of \'One Piece\' left by the late Pirate King, Gol D Roger.\n\r\nOf course the goal of being Pirate King really is just a loose objective set forward that eventually throws Luffy and his shipmates into a giant boiling pot full of problems and adventures.  What\'s special about this story is that it takes the most run-of-the-mill concepts and turns it into something fantastic and exciting. The concept of traveling from drastically different locations after locations is filled with endlessly creative characters and creatures that sets it apart from ever being dull, as opposed to say, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle where traveling to new worlds is a borefest and you can only hope the next world is interesting, and well if it\'s not ...have fun reading an entire arc on that filled with recycled characters.\n\r\nThe main plot device used in One Piece are the Devil Fruits, which grant anyone that eats them inhuman powers though at the deadly price of sinking like an anchor in the water; here the strange irony being that this is a series about pirates constantly on water. What makes this concept actually interesting is that every fruit has a different power and no two powers are the same, and Oda\'s endless imagination to come up with strange and hilarious powers. Above that, what makes this concept better than say, Bankai\'s or Kekkei Genkai\'s, is that you never know how two powers match up, so the weakest Devil Fruit powers in the current arc could very well be the key factor to winning a battle in the next, in that way, none of the characters ever seem so overpowered that they can completely destroy the other characters and it certainly adds an air of suspension and excitement to the battles that you wouldn\'t find in something like Sasuke vs. Konohamaru.\n\r\nThe story of One Piece may be simple and often straight out silly at times, but if you read deep enough, you\'ll realize that oftentimes the stories are much deeper and well-crafted than you would think they are, from the spark of a rebellion through misunderstandings to the questioning of an unfair God, One Piece can often surprise you through the story. One of the great things about One Piece when it comes to the story is that it\'s unpredictable, you never know where a fight is going, what\'s going to happen to the characters, who\'s going to win and who\'s going to turn out to be a good guy and who\'s going to be a bad guy, it\'s this element that makes everything that happens so intriguing and an extremely fun read.\n\r\nAnother well-done part of the story is that the stories of the characters are all intertwined so that it doesn\'t seem like the only thing holding all these characters together is through the main protagonist, the main antagonist of one arc may very well know the supporting ally of the next, and that just contributes to a more interesting read. Another strong point of the story is that Oda isn\'t afraid to bring back old characters, be it enemies or comical side characters and villains, they aren\'t just cut out of the story once their arc is over, they come back, some as allies and friends, this, in a sense, really fleshes out the One Piece world and makes the reader feel that the world does not revolve around The Straw Hat Pirates, but instead, the pirates of the Grand Line, all in all, it adds a sense of dimension to the story and makes it feel not as linear as it could be in the hands of a less skilled mangaka.\n\r\nBut what ultimately makes the story of One Piece so grand and exciting is thanks to two major components: 1) the emotional depth, and 2), Oda\'s masterful storytelling. The emotional depth in this series is amazing and can oftentimes leave one speechless, from the simple departure of a character to join the Straw Hats to the rescue of a friend in need, it\'s not emotionally complex ...it\'s just plain raw emotion of wanting to be loved or the sadness of losing a friend yet it achieves such a level of pure emotion and excitement that the likes of Bleach and Naruto can only dream of achieving. Now the second component that makes One Piece great is how Oda tells the story, he can build up the story to the point where you can feel the urgency, the sense of despair, and the feeling of something great happening. He creates cliffhangers, yet never makes it irritatingly frustrating, he inserts flashbacks, yet they never feel out of place or annoying to read, and the way he builds up the fights is just, for the lack of better worlds, epic. People say Gurren Lagann is exciting, well I\'d like to see those TTGL fans have a taste of what it feels as the Straw Hats infiltrate Enies Lobby or when The Eleven Supernovas gather at Sabaody Archipelago.\n\r\nCombine this with the perfect blend of humor (this manga is absolutely hilarious) and the sheer creativity of Oda and you got yourself an adventure of unequaled proportions.\n\r\nArt:\n\r\nThe bad thing with the art is that Oda\'s action sequences are so fast-paced and ambitious that it often times becomes muddled and a bit too messy; it gets hard to tell what\'s happening in these fight scenes and it takes a bit of imagination to understand what Oda is trying to do with these fight scenes, or else they come off rather cheesy at times, such as Luffy\'s Gomu Gomu no Gatling or Zoro\'s Kiki Kyūtōryū: Ashura.\n\r\nThe good on the other hand outweigh the bad of the art through the creative character designs that Oda just never seems to run out of, even if it\'s a character that appears in one panel and may never show up again, the utmost attention is given to his/her design so they never appear out of place compared to the other crazy designs he gives his characters. From the Okama Mr. 2 to the CP9 crew, the characters are all so different in appearance, size, and demeanor, it\'s hard to imagine how Oda keeps up. The sheer variability of the Straw Hat crew itself is a primary example of what a creative mangaka Oda is, as opposed to the recycled designs of his peers, Kishimoto and Kubo. Be it skeleton, reindeer, cyborg or witch, anyone and everyone is a likely candidate for the Straw Hat crew.\n\r\nAside from character designs, Oda really make the scenes feel cinematic and exciting, the tension and the sheer majestic and romantic quality of the adventure of the Straw Hats would never be fantastic without Oda\'s use of great art, from the crew getting ready to bombard Arlong Park to the storming of Enies Lobby, the examples go on. In short, Oda really knows how to pump you up through his art.\n\r\nLastly, the exaggerated expressions sometimes are just downright hilarious. I swear I laughed my ass off for at least five minutes when Enel made that huge WTF face after confronting Luffy.\n\r\nCharacter:\n\r\nThis is where One Piece is particularly strong in, and where this series shine at its greatest. One Piece\'s cast is colorful, hilarious, and unpredictable.  Currently, the Straw Hat crew consists of a rubber man, a pirate hunting pirate, a thief, a long nosed sniper, a womanizing cook, a transforming reindeer, a ""witch"", a cyborg that doesn\'t wear pants, and a walking skeleton.\n\r\nYep.\n\r\nEach character is unique, and when you throw a bunch like them together, the chemistry and interaction between the Straw Hat crew is comedic gold. And while they are almost always fooling around, each Straw Hat member has their own back stories that truly make them much deeper than what they appear to be at first. Brook is not just a joke character for variety, Nami is not just there to act like the straight man, Luffy isn\'t always a senseless fool, and Robin isn\'t just there to act like a damsel in distress (okay maybe she is ...kidding). The thing that needs to be pointed out is that the Straw Hat crew is a complex cast that is often much deeper than meets the eye.\n\r\nOutside the crew, both the friends the Straw Hat meet and the villains they confront are so freshly colorful and original, it never gets boring. The Shichibukai are just a perfect example of the variety of the One Piece cast, as well as CP9 and of course, Baroque Works. I would say it\'s pretty hard to find another cast so distinctive and creative as One Piece\'s. Of course the Devil Fruits certainly help in bringing the characters to life.\n\r\nLike previously mentioned, a strong point of the characters is how connected they are. The connections between characters are complex and can get pretty surprising sometimes. Who may appear as an old man could very well be friends with the former Pirate King and that whale that you saw at that mountain? Oh he\'s related to a guy you\'ll meet up with in a couple of hundred chapters. Some authors pull this kind of stuff out of nowhere (see: Kishimoto), but Oda plans out these kind of relations so intricately and carefully, you can\'t help but be impressed.\n\r\nAre there weak points to the characters? Certainly, there\'s a storyline that seems awfully repeated for the female crew-members of the Straw Hats, but the scale of the story is so big, that in the end, it doesn\'t matter that much and that one little slip-up never seemed like a big deal to begin with.\n\r\nEnjoyment:\n\r\nThis is the most enjoyable manga I have ever read. It\'s an absolute pleasure to read. Are there dull parts? At the beginning of every arc, there is always some exposition to be done, but once things enter full swing (and that is rather fast), damn, the chapters fly by in the hundreds, this is crack in manga form. If you want to know, I have spent entire days reading One Piece, that is how addicting this stuff is. With One Piece breaking records in sales in Japan, I think it speaks for itself when it comes to enjoyment.\n\r\nOverall:\n\r\nOne Piece is my favorite manga. Period. The story is such a grand and epic adventure, with each arc topping the previous; the characters are so tear-inducingly hilarious, and the art is so cinematic and exciting, One Piece is without the doubt, the greatest Shonen manga I\'ve ever had the pleasure of reading, and I doubt it will be topped anytime soon, if ever, as my favorite manga series. Cheers to Oda for creating this Shonen masterpiece, and may he continue to keep on going, One Piece is a manga that I love and hope to read for many many many years to come.\n\r\nYohohoho a pirate\'s life for me~']"
4,['Monster'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/1/Monster,"[""I rarely give tens to mangas. But this one just deserves it! Why? I'm going to tell you:\n\r\nMonster isn't a tradional manga. It isn't about fighting. I even dare to say it is a 'Love it or hate it'-manga. If you are the type of Naruto and Bleach and looking for that kind of manga, this isn't the manga for you. If you are looking for an intense, well-written manga, I would recommend this certainly for you.\n\r\nThe story is complex and long. Altough it's long, there isn't one single filler. It is all part of the same story. The story is about several characters, whom\n                  ...\nall have their own background and story. All the characters, you could just find them in real-life. And that is awesome. It all feels real and the flow of the story is... perfect.\n\r\nThe art was fine, although it isn't traditional drawn. Sometimes I thought the art was too unrealistic for the story. Some of the guys had way too big noses and stuff, but it wasn't really bothering though. \n\r\nI think it is hard to explain what is so perfect about this manga. The story is excellent, I think that is the main thing why I just like it so much. It is complex and intense, just like I said before. You will like the characters and follow their lives troughout the story. Tenma, the main character, goes from place to place and you get a peek into lives of other people. That is done so fantastic and real that you'll just start loving all those good people. \n\r\nThe story is so complex, it left me with quite some questions. It is a manga in which not everything will be explained. You will have to live with that and make conclusion for your own. I didn't like that first, but now I realise it perhaps is just fine. The actions of humans aren't always explained in real-life either....\n\r\nMy conclusion: This manga is perfect for everyone who loves thrillers and tension! The 10 it has gotten from me, well, it just deserves it!""]"
5,['Slam Dunk'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/51/Slam_Dunk,"[""Slam Dunk is probably the best manga ever published and the anime version is one of the best I have ever seen. Even though the series has ended more than a decade ago, many people  wiill wholeheartedly agree that this franchise has stood the test of time. \n\r\nThe story is simple but the execution is incredible, each chapter is filled with humor, action, drama, comedy and a whole lot more. The anime series was good and worthy of being considered a landmark anime, but if you have yet to see the anime then you don't know what you're missing. However there are things that\n                  ...\nare not shown in the anime series which is why it is crucial for you to read this manga. The interhigh games are a blast!\n\r\nTakehiko Inoue certainly knew how to end the series with a bang! The last game is so good, every character is at their best and certainly no other title can rile up the readers emotions like this, it really feels like your watching the NBA finals.\n\r\nThe artwork is simply great even though there are a lot of better looking manga out there, the decade old graphics still manages to go toe to toe with other more recent titles out there.\n\r\nThe characters of this title are by far the most fully developed in any title out in the market and I'm not just talking about the main characters, I'm also talking about the supporting cast even those belonging to rival teams. The character development is so good that it is difficult to choose one character as a favorite. Each character has a well told background even those who appear in just a few chapters have a very detailed and well executed background story. You'll probably remember the names of not only the Shohoku players but also the names of their rivals, most notably &quot;Sendoh&quot;.\n\r\nOverall Slam Dunk is one of the best Manga ever made and I'm sure that once you read it, you will agree with me. I guarantee that you won't be able to resist finishing the manga in a few days if not a few hours because it is that damn good. If you think the anime was great, try reading the manga and I'm sure you'll feel that the anime series could have been better, the interhigh games are one hell of a joyride!""]"
6,['Vinland Saga'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/642/Vinland_Saga,"[""Revenge, compassion, humanity, love.  Pointy weapons making minced meat of people.\n\r\nVinland Saga almost has nothing in common with Makoto Yukimura's previous much praised work, Planetes, except for his passion for technical realism.  He grounds his work with research, yet at the same time leaving it open for creative exploration.  It’s not dry and lifeless, and at the same time it’s not completely in the realm of fantasy.  Vinland saga walks the thin line well.  Razor blood soaked thin.\n\r\nThis manga is brutal.  More brutal than Berserk, Vagabond or anything of that ilk.  Not to slight those manga, but one\n                  ...\nis a fantasy and the other is an adaptation of a romanticising novel.  This manga is brutal because Vinland Saga's atrocities are reality-based and certainly not romanticised, whereas other manga usually are more fantastical or divided clearly between good and bad, right and wrong, black and white, or simply 'here is the protagonist, just root for him'.  Not so in Yukimura's love letter to old fashioned beheadings, as Vinland is about Vikings.\n\r\nVikings pillage villages, they rape and plunder.  There is no mercy and no survivors if they can help it.  There is no such thing as a Viking displaying the positive nouns mentioned in the first sentence of the review.  If Vikings arrive in your village, you will be killed or if you’re extremely lucky sold onto slavery, no matter if you’re young, old, man, woman or child.  Based in reality and unflinching, our youthful protagonist, Thorfinn, is a passive-observer to atrocity and active-partaker to violence when it’s in his best interest, to further his goal.  Revenge for his father.\n\r\nYukimura gets Thorfinn's flashback out of the way early in the story, and it’s a good decision as the boy is so fresh-faced, so loveable and innocent; his love for his father so pure, that to suddenly cut from the flashback back to the present and all the while leaving an essential gap in-between; the question that’s on the reader's mind for most of the manga is: how the hell did that young boy end up like this?\n\r\nThe flashback provides us with the motivation, the reasoning, but doesn’t reveal the details, the important montage of scenes showing a boy growing up and losing his humanity in the process; we don’t see it seep out of him gradually, which would be fascinating and make for great drama.  As of this review, we have yet to see this transition from normal child to adult killer, but I have no doubt Yukimura will provide us with more glimpses of what that boy went through to get to where he is when the story begins.\n\r\nThorfinn is a jaded efficient killer.  Silent and moody, he rarely speaks and when he does he is blunt and to the point.  He watches the world burn and die around him without blinking because he is already burnt and dead inside.  He can walk past a woman getting beaten and raped without a care in the world; this is the protagonist we're meant to root for.  Yukimura doesn’t go all out and have Thorfinn inflict misery on innocents, which would make the manga even more interesting, but would also alienate a large percentage of readers too.  As it is, as mentioned earlier, Yukimura walks that thin line with skill.\n\r\nWhat Vinland Saga is more about than anything else is revenge.  It is one of the best ideas to base a story around.  Not the 'man on a mission' revenge, but the exploration of the concept, the idea of it all.  Yukimura occasionally takes a break from the main story to focus on the concept via random characters, most humorously with a Christian priest who attempts to teach some Vikings about the concept of 'love' which they just don’t get.  This side-plot not only explores revenge and forgiveness, but dovetails into Thorfinn's own predicament neatly, forcing him to reflect on what he's doing with his life.\n\r\nThe main story follows Thorfinn’s target who he sticks to like glue, always ready to challenge him to a duel to the death, his only requirement for completing his revenge.  The brunt of all this rage and inexplicable adherence to honour, is an ambitious man seemingly lacking any of it himself, Askeladd seeks to rise in power through convoluted means and avoids becoming a cliché or a bore.  His design is almost amiable at times, with a laid back expression on his cunning face belying his actual ruthful nature to achieve his goals.  In short, he is not a one-note villain; he is many faceted like a few characters in the manga.  Yukimura flips in and out of actual history through this man’s arc, giving the reader cliffs notes on the politics of the time.  \n\r\nThe art, to be blunt like an axe disintegrating your face, is fantastic.  There is a leap in quality from the first volume to the second, and it is maintained consistently throughout thanks to Yukimura and his budding assistants.  There are plenty of memorable action sequences that are staged perfectly; lots of scope and perspective, and the composition is visceral.  The violence is in your face and disgusting.  Knife and sword thrusts are at times awkwardly landing into skin; fingers are thrust knuckle-deep into eye sockets.  It all makes you squirm but you love it because you're reading it in the safety of your own 21st century home.\n\r\nSo the violence is remarkably gross and blunt, sometimes gratuitous to please the crowd, but mostly it’s just disgusting.  The gore-hounds reading this will love it for that, but everyone else will feel repulsed, but in a good way because this is a story set amid war and conflict in the 11th century.  What do you expect, bloodless elbows into the ribs?\n\r\nThe story travels around Europe, from Denmark to the UK to Wales to Iceland, we watch the invasion of England affect different players to the drama and pull them in towards each other through interesting means.  There are sieges, manhunts, duels, chases, explosive action, edge of your seat tension, backstabs and unexpected partnerships, Vinland Saga has it all and is addictive reading while educating you along the way with its detailed depictions of an old way of life, from clothes, weaponry to customs and traditions.\n\r\nYukimura yet again uses the manga form to bring readers something a little different, a little more reflective of life outside of the pages.  Vinland Saga is a dirty mirror of a past raged by a war not remarkable for its reasons or details, but for the ancient race that battled passionately in it.  Vikings.  Seriously, don’t mess with them.""]"
7,['Fullmetal Alchemist'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/25/Fullmetal_Alchemist,"['One of the problems with something being truly good is that every so often it becomes a victim of its own success, and in a sense that\'s what happened with the fans of Full Metal Alchemist.\n\r\nArakawa Hiromu\'s tale of two brothers and their adventures in alchemy is one of the most well known stories in anime and manga to date, and has spawned a horde of games, a movie (with a second one planned), numerous doujins and fanfics, piles of merchandise ranging from tatoos to chibi plushies, and two very different anime series. The story itself is very typically shounen at times, however there is\n                  ...\na depth to proceedings that belies the initial look and feel of the manga. While things begin innocuously enough, it\'s not long before the reader finds themselves wrestling with moral, religious, and even philosophical motives and actions as the Elric brothers make their journey towards their destiny.\n\r\nEnough waxing lyrical, on to the nitty gritty. Anyone familiar with Arakawa\'s other works, especially her one shot manga, will undoubtedly find some surprising similarities to certain events and situations that occur in Full Metal Alchemist. The reason for this is because Arakawa had the foresight to test out various ideas in another form and format before adapting them for use in her flagship title, and this refinement process shows throughout the story. Although this is a shounen tale in the truest sense, there\'s a degree of complexity and innovation which has been carefully applied in an effort to draw the reader in, and this is one of the hallmarks of Arakawa\'s storytelling style.\n\r\nAs with any work though, there are a few areas that could have been improved upon. In an effort to lighten the mood from time to time the mangaka has seen fit to apply a few doses of comedy here and there, and while stories like Raiden 18 make it clear that Arakawa has some skills in that department, the application of humour in Full Metal Alchemist is sometimes a bit haphazard. That said, it seems like the mangaka herself also had a similar realisation as the tone of the series becomes much more serious during the latter half, and the frequency of comedic moments drops quite sharply. Surprisingly, the humour is less of a distraction and more of an anodyne for the reader during the later stages of the story, which is a testament to the idea that ""less is more"".\n\r\nThe artwork is very typical of the mangaka, however once more there is that look of refinement about the characters and settings, and even some of the action sequences. One big plus is that the reader is given a more visual, and sometimes visceral, look into the author\'s world than one might find in other shounen manga. That said, Rumiko Takahashi\'s InuYasha is a serious contender in this department, but like that manga, Full Metal Alchemist also suffers from the same problem - the highly stylized characters.\n\r\nThe main issue with the design is that some people may find it doesn\'t suit their tastes, which will in turn impact upon their appreciation of the story. That said, as an advocate of more individualism in manga and anime, it\'s nice to read something that remains true to the author\'s style as there are far too many titles that look identical to each other (e.g. harem romantic comedies and about half of the shoujo manga out there).\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, suffice to say that the development of the lead roles is very good indeed, and the supporting roles are given a healthy amount of space to shine as well. One of the more interesting aspects is the pace at which the characters are developed throughout the story, and a big plus is the degree of attention given to the ""bad guys"", especially later in the series. It\'s a sad fact that shounen tales are filled with shallow antagonists who serve no other purpose than to give the lead character a wall they must ""beat down"" in order to move the story forward, and while Full Metal Alchemist contains the basic elements of this type of progression, it manages to mask them far better than most action manga out there.\n\r\nIs there a major downside then? Well, unfortunately there is, but it\'s one that\'s very much dependent on personal taste. The reason why the Full Metal Alchemist franchise is a victim of its own success is because of the original anime adaptation of the unfinished manga.\n\r\nNow one of the problems that fans have is that the two versions of the tale are wildly different in terms of atmosphere, story and character mentality (basically they\'re like chalk and cheese). The main issue at hand is that while the manga version of Full Metal Alchemist is an excellent series, the original anime adaptation is becoming maligned and misunderstood because it deviates too much from Arakawa\'s story. Personally I consider both to be equally good, just not in the same way.\n\r\nHere\'s what I mean.\n\r\nArakawa\'s manga is a very good story that incorporates a number of typical shounen aspects like never giving up, trusting in one\'s friends and allies, etc, and while the tale is excellent in both content and execution, in all honesty, it lacks a degree of ""darkness"" that was inherent in the first anime. One of the things that struck me about this dissonance was the fact that the whole theme of obsession seems to peter out by the end of the manga, whereas the first anime actually ended with that theme still running strong.\n\r\nNow, some of you maybe a little confused by that perspective, especially as both tales feature the same characters to a degree, however one look at their respective endings will begin to make things a little clearer, and pay particular attention to Alphonse Elric as he is the reason why I consider the two tales to be so very different (and if you\'re still unsure, then feel free to ask me about it).\n\r\nIt\'s pretty obvious that I enjoyed Full Metal Alchemist immensely, however my only real gripe with the manga, especially after reading Arakawa\'s other works, is that there are too many occasions where it feels like the author has purposely moved away from a theme or situation that was used in the original anime, and this can make parts of the story feel a bit rushed. That said, this is actually a minor problem as the whole tale fits together extremely well, and in terms of content Full Metal Alchemist is easily on par with Takahashi Rumiko\'s masterpiece.\n\r\nWhat Arakawa Hiromu has given us is a work that is truly good, despite some minor niggles here and there, and while there are some typically shounen aspects to the tale, Full Metal Alchemist, like Inuaysha, is a far cry from what one would consider a typical shounen manga.\n\r\nIsn\'t it ironic then, that the two of greatest shounen tales weren\'t written by men?']"

9,['Oyasumi Punpun'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/4632/Oyasumi_Punpun,"[""Oyasumi Punpun is the best example I have ever found of something which you should not judge by its literal cover. Looking at the picture on MAL, I initially thought the story was about some young girl and a weird penguin/bird thing and only really added it to my list because it’s ranked #15 on this site. It was not until after I read another manga by the author, Asano Inio, called Nijigahara Holograph, and looked more into what this manga was actually about, that I finally decided to read it. And I could not have been more wrong in my initial assumption. But enough\n                  ...\nabout that intro which was just to help dispel any similar thoughts people looking at this manga might have, I’ll get into the real review now.\n\r\nSo many manga (and actually many things in about every single story-telling medium that humans have ever had) often try to create likeable characters, a plot that while it may have many sad parts manages to rebound and become upbeat at some points, and/or very unrealistic characters or settings. Oyasumi Punpun is basically the opposite of all of that.\n\r\nDespite having comedy in the beginning (which is 99% black humor anyway), Oyasumi Punpun is possibly one of the most depressing and realistic things I have ever come across. It is the “coming of age” story of a boy named Punyama (later Onodera) Punpun, and follows him all the way from elementary school until around his early 20’s. What makes this manga so special is the heavy psychological aspects surrounding Punpun and everyone else throughout the story. One of the main psychological aspects of the story has to do with Punpun’s character design. He, as well as his family, start off looking like some kind of 2 dimensional birds with long legs. His design changes a lot later on to reflect how he is feeling on the inside, but the important thing to remember is that he looks just like a normal human being to everyone else in the manga and that he does not actually look like a “bird-thing” to them.\n\r\nThe story of Oyasumi Punpun begins with Punpun in elementary school. The girl he had a crush on has just transferred out of his school, but shortly afterward a new girl named Tanaka Aiko transfers into his school. It’s love at first sight for Punpun. He starts to slowly grow closer to Aiko while at the same time hanging out with friends and just being a normal boy who is entering puberty. Among his group of friends (I’ll just name the ones who are important at some point later on because I don’t really remember the others) there are Shuntarou Harumi, a nice boy who wears glasses; Seki Masumi, a delinquent boy with family problems; Shimizu Koh, a strange boy who can see the “god of poop” and who has been friends with Seki since childhood. The group of about 6 boys in total is just your average group of male friends who enjoy finding porn magazines, doing tests of courage, and spending their time just trying to enjoy themselves. I won’t talk any more about the story because going any farther in any way would spoil things. There’s just so many things that Asano Inio goes into amazing detail about in this dark and depressing story that explaining any more would ruin some part of it. The story covers a lot of time as I already mentioned and Punpun’s elementary school life is only a small, yet very crucial part of the entire plot.\n\r\nAs for the art, it’s simply amazing. The idea of making Punpun look different to the reader than to everyone else is a great way to show his true emotions in a way that showing him as he really looks could not. As for the other character designs, they are all very well drawn especially Punpun’s family who also resemble 2D birds with long legs. The people who look like normal humans are usually drawn normally, but they can look ugly at times or beautiful at times when the author wants to make them look similar to how they are feeling. Especially with Shimizu (who is usually seen with a runny nose) he can actually look very intelligent at times despite normally seeming to be the exact opposite. \r\nAlso, this manga is very mature and occasionally contains nudity, but it is never used as fanservice and is only used to increase the darkness of situations and to expand on the imperfections of the characters.\n\r\nThe backgrounds are even better than the character designs. The varying settings that take place in different locations throughout the manga never slack in a single frame and stay consistently good throughout the story. The art right from the beginning is great which is something I can’t say about all long manga that are published over many years. One feature of the art which Asano Inio often uses is that he will keep the same background for several panels but the images in the foreground (people, objects, etc.) will change. While I normally don’t like repetitive panels (or shots in anime), Inio uses this to increase the psychological aspects as well as the importance of these scenes. He makes the reader focus on what is happening and draws you in in a way where you suddenly realize five chapters later that you are not actually in Punpun’s world but are sitting in the real world. And this repeats many times (at least it did for me) over the course of the manga. The art is so realistic and perfectly depressing that it just fits this manga so excellently in every aspect and I really can’t find anything bad to say about it.\n\r\nNow, the characters are possibly the most “interesting” part of the manga. As I mentioned in the very beginning, these characters are not meant to all be likable. In fact, none of them are my favorite characters despite this being one of my favorite manga. But that’s not really the point, since they are meant to be realistic. I would never consider myself or any of the people in my life one of my favorite characters if they were in an anime or manga. Real life people are much simpler than anime characters that each have bold hairstyles, unique weapons, perfect figures, etc. Real humans are not perfect, do not always have a happy ending in life, and are usually just some unnoticeable background character that you pass by once or twice during your life but leave no impact on you at all.\n\r\nPunpun is your average Japanese person aside from the slightly inflated psychological issues at times (but still never something that real humans have not experienced). As a child, Punpun’s uncle taught him that if he said a certain phrase, God would appear to him and help him in his time of need. Inio depicts God like a bad imaginary friend who looks like a black guy with an afro and usually gives Punpun poor advice that is kind of like a “worst case scenario to do” rather than actual help. Punpun’s journey to becoming an adult is a difficult one filled with family issues, romantic problems, sex, alcohol, depression, different jobs, etc. Oyasumi Punpun is not a happy story at all, and Punpun never even goes one chapter without being sad, questioning himself, or making a bad decision at some point (aside from the chapters that he is not in). He has many flaws and as he grows up, he starts to notice more and more of them. Punpun is the kind of person (as is often stated) who is always looking back into the past and has a hard time looking towards the future. With his kind of depressing life, looking at his past is not the most enjoyable thing to do. He has many regrets and things he wishes he could do differently if given the chance. As the story progresses, he falls farther and farther away from how he used to be as a cheerful child who dreamed of becoming a scientist in space. Many characters talk about how he is too kind and often hurts people because of his kindness and how easily he apologizes for things.\n\r\nPunpun is one of the only parts where I think the manga has a couple problems. While overall I actually like Punpun a lot, sometimes he just makes decisions that are a little too stupid even for him. In the later chapters, I feel like Punpun becomes mean and a little annoying at times, though this is mainly due to an overload of stress and is honestly not really anything too surprising given his difficult circumstances. It’s not enough to hurt the manga overall, but I thought I should mention it. Inio acknowledges that Punpun has changed a lot as well by drawing him in an extremely different way than he was ever depicted before. Punpun's main source of drama comes from remembering his middle school crush Aiko. Punpun seems to always be going back and thinking about Aiko, and much of the parts that I dislike a little about him involve her.\n\r\nSeki and Shimizu follow kind of a side story for most of the manga. After middle school, they never really see Punpun at all, yet they are still very important characters in the story. They have been friends since preschool and Seki has always had to take care of Shimizu. Shimizu is just a strange boy who can see the “god of poop” in a way that is kind of similar to how Punpun can see God (minus the horrible advice that Punpun gets). As they grow up, they try to stick together but many problems threaten to tear their friendship apart. Seki has always been a delinquent and keeps getting into more and more trouble. Shimizu has always been gullible and somewhat childish but he tries to become more independent. I really enjoy their story and I think they're two of the better characters in this manga. Their relationship is just like a bond between two really good childhood friends and is very believable.\n\r\nThroughout the manga, Punpun goes through different drama and relationships, problems and anxieties, and different designs. The characters he meets (especially the girls he is close to) change each time. The story often focuses on characters other than Punpun in order to piece together the entire story. I won’t talk about all them as it would take too long, but if you want to see all of the characters who are very important at some point, just go to the character list.\n\r\nThis is now one of my favorite manga and only the second that I have given a 10/10 rating to. It’s a masterpiece that shows how real life works and how all of the problems in real life are not easily solvable like they are in many stories. It may be one of the most depressing manga out there, but if you can handle that kind of story as well as many mature themes and some nudity, then I highly recommend Oyasumi Punpun. It’s not something you should go into lightly, but if you enjoy these kind of life-changing stories, then this is something you should not miss.""]"
10,['Kingdom'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/16765/Kingdom,"[""I've always been a bit puzzled as to why Kingdom isn't any more popular on this site. Despite having been publishing on a consistent weekly basis for nearly a decade by now, and despite being one of the highest rated manga on MAL, I still essentially never see anyone talk about it. It almost feels like people aren't even aware that it exists. I think this is very unfortunate, because they're missing out on what is perhaps the most inspirational manga I've ever had the pleasure of reading.\n\r\nThe story takes place during the Chinese Warring States period. After a full 500 years of constant warfare\n                  ...\nbetween the various states of China, the bloodshed still shows no sign of stopping anytime soon. It is here our story begins with a young man named Shin who has the naïve dream of becoming the greatest general in all of China. After accidentally becoming involved in a conflict over the royal throne of the state of Qin, he eventually ends up serving under the new young king who has the ambition to one day unite all of China under one banner.\n\r\nAs a result, Kingdom is a manga of epic proportions, containing large scale warfare with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, advanced military strategizing and incredible intensity. The battles are long and complicated, but perfectly understandable as the author's style of writing is extremely detailed and also utilizes tons of tactical maps, overviews and time jumps to explain the flow of combat. It's intelligent but without requiring much from the reader in order to keep up with the plot.\n\r\nAt the same time Kingdom also has extremely in-depth national politics and diplomacy between nations, further enhancing the overall sense of realism. Speaking of which, it should be stated that the manga is in fact based on true events and characters from Chinese history. Of course it's only loosely based on it as the historical records only dictate *what* happens, but the author is the one who decides *how* it happens. In other words he manages to create a story which is perhaps exaggeratedly epic, yet still never contradicts the actual true events. \n\r\nThe best part of Kingdom however is undoubtedly the characters. The story covers many years of time, and thus you get to see how everyone gradually grows and evolves over the course of time in very high detail. There are hundreds and hundreds of notable figures in the story, consisting of generals, commanders, soldiers, civilians, politicians, royalty and more. Especially the main military figures are superbly written, with incredible charisma and all with their own individual traits. The vast majority of them are almost impossible to dislike, regardless of which state they may come from. The amount of color they bring to the battlefield simply cannot be understated, and it feels like they're not just raising the morale of their respective soldiers in the manga itself, but the morale of the readers as well. At the same time, some of the death scenes in this manga are some of the most tragic and emotional death scenes I've ever seen in media. When one of your favorite characters passes away, you will truly feel it. Furthermore, the sheer amount of inspirational and downright moving speeches throughout the course of Kingdom is simply astonishing. The author truly knows how to touch the hearts of the readers with the way he's written the story. I really cannot praise him enough for it.\n\r\nThe art is extremely high detail and helps to amplify the level of intensity of the story. Especially the armies and the battlefields look simply fantastic and sometimes it makes you feel like you're really there. While it may not exactly be on the level of something like Berserk in terms of visuals, it's still more than enough to appropriately showcase the cold and harsh reality of the field of battle, and deliver that atmosphere to the readers first-hand.\n\r\nKingdom has some very long arcs occasionally during the more drawn-out battles, and I'll just say here and now that when you're in one of those segments, it's effectively impossible to stop reading it. Why? Because every single chapter ends in a huge cliffhanger! This is one of those stories which just keeps teasing you and forces you to keep reading the next chapter. And the next one. And the next one. And the- ...you get the idea. Point being that despite it having over 400 chapters published at the time of writing this, you can still easily read through all of it in just a few days, no problem whatsoever. It's just *that* addictive once you start.\n\r\nOverall, in my eyes Kingdom is a manga which seriously needs more attention. I'm still not sure exactly why so few people have read it, but I really wish more people would give it a chance because it truly is one of the most influential and impressive manga out there. It stands out as a very atypical manga to begin with, but above all it is exceedingly rare for a story to be so action-packed, so intelligent yet so incredibly emotional all at the same time.""]"

There are manga out there about any subject, topic or issue.  There is a manga out there for everyone.  Real is for everyone.  Everyone with matured tastes anyway.  It needs to be made clear that this manga is heavy on characterisation and not on battle royales involving hoops.\n\r\nTakehiko Inoue's Real is his most mature and accomplished work.  You won’t find constant court action here with secret techniques powering up people.  This is a tale about three young men, the issue\n                  ...\nof disability in Japan, and of course basketball.\n\r\nNomiya is a rash outspoken school dropout searching for a purpose in life.  Everything about him says he should not give a shit and just be a hooligan, but inside that rough exterior of his is a decent person wanting to make good use of his life.  This is a man who acknowledges who he is, a very mature act indeed.  He looks for redemption in the girl who he caused to become disabled thanks to a traffic accident.\n\r\nTogawa is already in a wheelchair and a rabid basketball player.  His arc is more predictable in the Slam Dunk mould of wanting to be a better player, setting his sights on a rival to use as a measuring stick for his own skills.  How he got into the wheelchair is more interesting than what he's doing in it, but regardless his predicament is still engaging in a conventional sense.  You root for him to succeed.\n\r\nTakahashi is an antagonist introduced early on, making Nomiya's life a misery by not adhering to the spirit of sportsmanship, causing Nomiya to become an outcast by turning the school team against him.  He's pretty much your typical teenager, ugly egotistical traits and all.  He unexpectedly becomes the reader's guide to disability and enables Takehiko Inoue to explore the horror of having control of your own body and senses wrenched away from you.  This character's arc is by far the most compelling, as Inoue slowly turns the hateful archetypical bully of the first volume into a relatable person by the fourth.\n\r\nReading this manga I kept trying to spot how Takehiko Inoue would go wrong; would make glaring mistakes or fall for convention.  But he doesn’t.  There's no typical genre formula for the basketball games, there's no beat by beat rundown of disability like you'd expect in some shonen genre tale with commentators spelling everything out for you.  This is simply a tale led by three main characters dealing with what’s real in their lives, how to differentiate between reality and fantasy whether it be in society status or relationships, the falsities between the lines, how to hold onto truths, how to discover them in the first place.\n\r\nHow to deal with the cold harsh and undeniably true-to-life act of being abandoned by your so-called friends when you lose the ability to walk.  How to continue to live in your new state, bearing that crushing defeat, the humiliation and loneliness that comes rushing in when you are outcast by nearly everyone in your life.\n\r\nReal is Takehiko Inoue's best manga to date, it doesn’t use basketball games as a crutch, it doesnt revel in clichéd tropes of manga, it’s just simply a compelling story with a backdrop that’s rare to the manga form, so kudos to the author for going there and tackling it responsibly and creatively.\n\r\nReal isn’t going to be everyone's cup of tea, because some are so used to associating manga with certain tropes.  This most certainly isn’t Slam Dunk part two, but if you've an open mind and want to be pulled into the plights and trials of three young Japanese men dealing with life's challenges, drawn exquisitely by one of manga's most skilled artists, then read Real.""]"

Then one of their number becomes one of the dead, and all the clues point Kenji to a mysterious man who calls himself &quot;Tomodachi (Friend),&quot; who uses as his sign a symbol known only to Kenji's circle of friends.\n\r\nAs the scale of damage and the number of deaths rapidly increase, Kenji realizes that all the terrors are occurring as he had once set down on paper, in a story he and his friends had written, and buried in the time capsule they had sworn over.\n\r\n20th Century Boys is difficult for me to summarize without giving too much away, but even if I were to divulge half of its secrets, we would still not be anywhere near solving the mystery of &quot;Friend&quot; and of his motives.\n\r\nAt first glance, 20thCB seems to be a crude shounen manga that would probably not appeal to everyone, judging by the artwork alone. But it is not. True, there are no pretty boys or girls to easily fangirl (or boy) over in this series, but this kind of story does not need exaggerated, surreal beauty in its artwork to survive. This truly is a graphic novel, where the plot moves with speed, certainty, and intelligence rather than rely on hundreds of feathers and cherry blossoms to depict angst and drama. The art is actually pretty polished as well, the inking clean and deliberate, and the panels arranged simply but effectively. Like movies these days, many manga artists tend to rely on &quot;special effects&quot; or glamorous art rather than plot to attract readers, but 20thCB has enough plot that any eye candy would just be a bonus.\n\r\nCharacter development in 20thCB is also something I liked. Kenji grows and changes as the series progresses, and so do the other characters. The dynamics between the friends are believable, and their heroism so simple and understated.\n\r\nI can't really find much to say about this manga, simply because it's so good and interesting and I probably wouldn't be able to do it much justice. But if you're looking for a fast-paced intelligent plot, masterfully created characters, and a mystery that can have you at the edge of your seat, then give this series a chance.""]"
14,['Ashita no Joe'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/1303/Ashita_no_Joe,"[""Simply put, Ashita no Joe is nothing short of a timeless masterpiece of a manga. This really is likely to be one of the greatest manga creations that has ever been created as well as one of the greatest that will ever be created. In every single medium, whether it be in literature, film or anything else for that matter, there are a select few creations that manage to transcend the media in and off itself and become something truly epic, truly beautiful and truly classic. Ashita no Joe manages to pull of this staggering feat. It manages to go far beyond being just another\n                  ...\ninspirational story about one scrappy young lad's rise to the top of his particular sport. Ashita no Joe is a grand story about the entire life of it's main character, poignantly detailing all of the excruciating pain and suffering, expressing every thought and every action with moving and genuinely emotional realism. It is for this reason that anyone with even a modicum of admiration to the thing that we call manga owes it to themselves to check out this series at one point or another.\n\r\nIt wouldn't exactly be wrong to say that the story of Ashita no Joe starts out in a fairly cliche way. The protagonist of this sports manga starts life as some no name punk who wanders around the streets as he has no place to belong but then that all changes when he comes across Danpei Tange who is a failed boxing coach turned drunkard who spots Joe's innate boxing talent and proclaims that with his training Joe's fists will someday conquer the boxing world. While this may sound similar to things you may have seen in other series it must be remembered that Ashita no Joe is one of the pioneers for the genre and that most of those other series are actually just inspired in one way or another by this series.\n\r\nThis being a sporting based series the plot has that tendency to progress in a very predictable manner. There's a fight announced, a rivalry develops, the two rivals finally square of in the ring and after the fight ends the cycle begins once more, but I would just like to say that the plot in the series is really anything but conventional. There are many unexpected plot twists and I can guarantee that certain events in this story will simply leave your mouth agape and you'll find yourself nearly paralyzed by the shock of what you've just read, yes really, things really are that intense in this manga.\n\r\nUnlike many other manga series that come under the category of sports, Ashita no Joe is not exactly a cheerful or uplifting series. At points it's very brooding, the atmosphere is dark and serious and often sombre and melancholic. This series takes itself seriously and the story of Ashita no Joe is a very serious one. The heavy tone of this series separates it from others and is very important in getting across the importance of the story and the severity of life as a boxer as well as life in general.\n\r\nWhile structurally speaking the story of Ashita no Joe may be described as being simplistic the delivery of said story is terrific, the plot is rock solid, the interactions between characters is deep, insightful and meaningful and the progression of the story is without a single flaw. But what I really think sets Ashita no Joe apart from other similar series is how the writer's message transcends the sport of boxing entirely. This is a story about one man's life and his struggles and this is what makes the core of the story and it's the messages that can be found within that makes this story nothing short of masterful.\n\r\nMoving on to the thing that connects everything and brings the story to life for the readers; the characters. The characters in Ashita no Joe are spectacular to say the least. Let's begin with the main character, the wild brawler Joe Yabuki. Joe starts life as little more than a piece of human garbage drifting through the slums of Tokyo. Nothing but a wretched orphan that cares for nothing but himself, a prankster that gets his kicks from making the lives of those around him a misery, a rebel that goes against everything that modern society stands for. A directionless punk with no prospects, Joe would have simply wasted away if it wasn't for the interference of the stubborn Tange who would do literally anything within his power to turn Joe into a boxer. Joe's life as a street punk eventually comes to an end when his actions finally catch up to him and he's thrown into juvie. Within the confined space Joe's  only salvation was the boxing training he received from Tange that kept him going.\n\r\nJoe's passion for boxing was then finally ignited once and for all once he met his greatest rival, Rikiishi. Riikishi, while also spending time in the correctional facility was the complete opposite of Joe. He was a fine upstanding man that was destined to become a great boxer. And well it's at this point that you could say the story really starts. From this point Joe Yabuki, the wild beast that defies the very logic of the world of boxing begins to charge forward recklessly, never letting anyone interfere, never letting anyone stand in his way, never once compromising, never going against his principles as a man, even if it would lead to his own destruction, Joe lashes out against his opponent who stands on the other side of the ring.\n\r\nThere are many characters in this series that I'd like to talk about in depth but I feel as though I shouldn't because I feel like I'd be spoiling things for those who've yet to read the series, so I'm just going to tell you flat, the cast of characters in this series are magnificent and are one of the many, many things that make the series so great.\n\r\nNow, I suppose many people who are thinking about reading this are probably being put off because it's too old and the artwork may not be up to the standard of more modern series. But frankly speaking the artwork is great. Granted the designs of the characters are outdated but the actual level of expression in the faces surpasses many modern series and also the level of detail put into the background goes far beyond most anything you see these days. Also the fight scenes are all brilliant to read. While initially the artwork may be a tad polarizing, all you need to do is get accustomed to it, so just give it a chance.\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor in this series is a little difficult to sum up. This story is very heavy and it doesn't hold any punches. At times it is very emotive and at times you'll just feel bad and depressed once you finished a volume but that is really the strongest point of the series. It never set out to be a happy story in the first place. It's an emotive story that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. And it's exactly because of the nature of this story that it is just so much more impactful than damn near anything I've ever read.\n\r\nSo if you are still wondering whether or not you should read Ashita no Joe then let me just say yes definitely. I mean don't even finish this review, just go read it right now. If you're worried about not having enough knowledge about boxing then that really isn't a problem. Personally I only watch boxing a couple of times a year. I'm definitely no expert and yet I had no difficulty with this series.""]"
15,['Monogatari Series: First Season'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/14893/Monogatari_Series__First_Season,"['If you are here, it means either you are a big fan of Nishio Ishin, or saw the anime Bakemonogatari and fall in love with it. Monogatari series, as expected from Nishio Ishin, is full of Japanese word plays and definition intonation; what I mean is it is hard to understand from just reading it once. From here and now will be a review of the book, not the anime.\n\r\nBefore getting into review and ""a bit"" of spoilers, here is the timeline of the story\n\r\nKizumonogatari -> Nekomonogatari Kuro -> Bakemonogatari -> Nisemonogatari\n\r\nNow let\'s start this.\n\r\nBakemonogatari:\r\nConsist of different girls possessed by different Kai\'i(Oddity or strangeness). Senjogahara\n                  ...\nHitagi possessed by a Crab, Kanbaru Suruga possessed by a Monkey, Hachikuji Mayoi possessed by a Snail, Sengoku Nadeko possessed by a Snake, and Hanekawa Tsubasa (re)possessed by a Cat. Each had a reason to why and how they where possessed to these oddities and you can find that out by reading the novel or already know from the anime. Araragi Koyomi basically helps these young ladies to remove these oddities from them, and the point is he only ""helps"", not actually ""saves"" them. Bakemonogatari, as it\'s name is a collection of stories(monogatari) of monsters, or oddities(Bakemono).\n\r\nKizumonogatari:\r\nKoyomi Vamp. Yes, why wouldn\'t have our dear main male character not be possessed by a oddity? Araragi Koyomi, one day, meets a Vampire, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, on the way back to his home. Kiss-Shot was heavily injured, and Koyomi gives up all his blood to her to save her, and from this, Kiss-Shot turns Koyomi into a Vampire. Kizumonogatari is the ""Beginning"" of the all the monogatari series. The point to pay attention to this story is not only thrilling battle scenes or the beauty of Kiss-Shot, but more of our dear almighty class-representative, Hanekawa Tsubasa. Kizumonogatari is a story where one and others hurt each other creating scars (Kizu) to each other.\n\r\nNisemonogatari:\r\nThere is a real and there is a fake imposter of that real. Now, which one has the more value?\n\r\nNisemonogatari features the story of Araragi Koyomi\'s cute little sisters, Araragi Karen and Tsukihi, the Fire Sisters. ""Fire"" is one feature to keep in mind for Nisemonogatari and Nekomongatari Shiro, but for Nisemonogatari, fire comes from the name of Karen and Tsukihi (Ren = fire, hi = fire). Karen is self-proclaimed ""Moreu Onna"" (Burning women), which she meant to explain her extraordinary passion towards everything. Tsukihi, is not passionate, but has a personality of that of a fire, hysteric. Main point of the story to pay a close attention is the Kaiki Deishu\'s logic towards fake and false. We can even say that Kaiki is the main character of the story, rather than Karen and Tsukihi. Nisemonogatari is a story where what can be called fake/imposter (Nise) and the true value of the world.\n\r\nNekomonogatari Kuro:\r\nThe talk of there being no such thing as right, is right.\n\r\nNekomonogatari Kuro is, yes a story of a cat(neko), but it\'s not that cute at all, or rather, a bit gruesome; Nekomonogatari Kuro and even go par with the Suruga Monkey from Bakemonogatari. The story takes place in between the Kizu and Bake, and is about Hanekawa Tsubasa and her meeting with a Cat, and more about the family of Hanekawa. Beginning starts with Koyomi\'s confession to Tsukihi that he can\'t stop thinking about Hanekawa\'s breasts, comedy, and then rapidly turns into serious story. Nekomonogatari Kuro, in another way to say it, Tsubasa Family, is about Hanekawa Tsubasa and her life in her family. The reason why Kuro (black) is added to it, you can find it out by yourself. Main point to pay attention to this story is the family issue, and the Oshino Meme\'s logic and Araragi Koyomi\'s logic towards people, or more about Hanekawa Tsubasa.\n\r\nNishio Ishin thank you for publishing books in out of time line for sakes. But still, I loved it, especially Nisemono and Nekomono Kuro. For people who are not a great fan of reading too much words, or not interested in beauty of Kanji and their true meanings, I really do not recommend any of Nishio Ishin\'s novel, but for the rest, Monogatari series is the best to know Nishio Ishin\'s writing style.\n\r\nps. All of them are available as anime so if you are confused or auditory learner, then go watch it after/before. It will make more sense.']"
16,['Monogatari Series: Second Season'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/23751/Monogatari_Series__Second_Season,"['Ah yes, the second season. This is the Monogatari series at its absolute best, with almost every book in this season being at least a 9/10.\n\r\nBefore I start though, to newcomers who have yet to read it, The Monogatari series has a really confusing timeline, and this season is when it starts to show. I wouldn\'t say that reading it in the published order is wrong, but I believe that reading Onimonogatari right after Kabukimonogatari and reading Otorimonogatari right before Koimonogatari would make for a less jarring experience, though it\'s not a must. \n\r\nAnyways, right back to the review. The second season is where the\n                  ...\ncharacters, after being established solidly in the first season, shine at their brightest. In fact, my opinion on almost every character skyrocketed right after reading the second season. This is done through NisiOisin\'s clever replacement of the point of view characters, such as letting Hanekawa and Senjougahara take the reins as protagonist of their respective novels. Of course, our boy Araragi still has two novels of the season for himself, but this change in perspective is refreshing and ingenious. \n\r\nThe second season starts out extremely strong, with Neko White. Hanekawa\'s arc throughout the first season comes to somewhat of a closure with Neko White, and this definitely is the most ""beautiful"" novel in the series. Getting into Hanekawa\'s mind and viewing events from her perspective is both refreshing and fascinating, and seeing characters from a different perspective compared to how araragi sees them is one of the highlights of these different point of view novels. Anyways, the way the story unfolds is slow but gripping, and the way it ends is definitely one of the most bittersweet endings in the series. All in all, truly a fantastic read, definitely one of the best novels in the series, and it got me to really love Hanekawa.\n\r\nRight after that we have Kabukimonogatari, probably the most underrated book in my opinion. Not going to spoil much because discovering what the plot of this particular novel is had me cracking up at how bizarre it is, but it truly is the most outlandish novel yet at least. Shinobu was a character that I felt needed more screentime in the first season, and despite this technically being Hachikuji\'s arc Shinobu definitely was the star. Seeing Shinobu\'s and Araragi\'s relationship develop was fantastic, and this novel was extremely thrilling to read, with many twists and turns, all culminating into one hell of an ending. \n\r\nNext, we have Hanamonogatari, which is probably the greatest outlier in this season. Why? Because for some reason, NisiOisin decided to jump all the way to the next year, skipping over all the many events that would happen later in the season, and focus on Kanbaru. Not complaining though, because Kanbaru is definitely one of my favorites. Hanamonogatari has gotten criticism for being much more of a slower burn than the other novels, but I think that\'s what makes it so good. Seeing things from Kanbaru\'s perspective is an absolute delight, and Rouka makes for a great foil for Kanbaru. Ultimately, this novel tackles Kanbaru\'s growth, and it\'s a great read.\n\r\nThen, there\'s Otorimonogatari. Otorimonogatari now focuses on Sengoku, aka ms renai circulation, and Sengoku\'s growth from being my least favorite heroine to being one of my all time favorites definitely has to do with this book. Sengoku\'s character is extremely fascinating to read, and the way her character changes throughout the novel, and with one hell of a plot twist nearing the end, is jaw droppingly gripping. This novel gave perspective on Sengoku, and made her so much more fascinating than just a cute girl. \n\r\nOnimonogatari is probably my least favorite of the season, mainly because of how Shinobu spends a pretty long time explaining her past, which was interesting at first but got a bit too drawn out imo. But who cares, because all three lolis are in this novel, and it is a delight. The three characters, Shinobu, Hachikuji and Ononoki, are all extremely enjoyable to read, and they bounce of Araragi really well. The whole concept of a tracking Black Hole is also pretty intriguing. Again, my main issue is the first half of the book, but after that it is extremely fun to read. Until of course, the ending, which is definitely the saddest scene in the series. \n\r\nAnd then lastly, Koimonogatari. Starring Senjougahara, and Kaiki as well, Koimonogatari deals with the fallout that occurred at the end of Otorimonogatari, and it is oh so good. This novel is arguably the best in the series, mostly due to Kaiki carrying this tale. Senjougahara is fantastic as well, i\'m especially a fan of how much she grew since the first season, however Kaiki just steals so many scenes you\'d wonder why he isn\'t the main POV of this novel, but oh well. The plot is gripping and exciting, with probably the highest stakes so far in the series. The ending is as always fantastic, and it wraps up the main conflict of the second season in a very satisfying way. Also, this novel was when Ougi becomes extremely suspicious, which is definitely set up for the next season.\n\r\nIn conclusion, the second season\'s greatest strength is definitely the characters. Every character that had a major role went through much more development and fleshing out, and with more plot elements being introduced, this season masterfully sets up the next season.']"

That is to say before writing a really cruel scene, I have to lift the people\'s spirits, for example, with a fun scene... Before writing a scene of pure despair, we must go through scenes of hope. And indeed, when I write, all of this amuses me very much.""\r\n- Sadist07\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\r\nStory: 10/10\n\r\nA witch is born when human reasoning is incapable of explaining a mystery.\r\nA witch is born out of the need for escape.\r\nThe previous episodes explained that the difference between reality and fantasy might only be paper-thin, at the same time only ever giving part of an increasingly\n                  ...\nbleak truth. In the same way, Ryukishi07 never ceases to toy with the reader - exploiting the desire for a fantasy, making them see something which isn\'t really there.\n\r\nSimilar to Higurashi, only after reaching the ending does it become possible to appreciate the scale and intricacy of his work. At first glance, it seems that each episode of Umineko is 90% fiction and 10% fact, like a jigsaw puzzle where many of the tiles don\'t fit anywhere. \n\r\nOr, it could also be compared to an onion, because I have no idea how he managed to include so many LAYERS BUT I\'M CRYING ANYWAY.\n\r\nRegardless, as fragments of 1986 are finally pieced together, it seems inevitable that the completed jigsaw is painted with a tragedy.\n\r\nAt first, each character\'s story throughout the series appears to relay a certain message: love is a source of madness which distorts the truth. Though somebody might want to live in a magical fantasy forever... eventually, it\'s time to grow up. It\'s a cold reality which is incompatible with the idea of a golden witch who you can blame all your problems on.\n\r\nThat\'s what this episode is really about - growing up without losing your magic. More than hunting down the truth in the previous episodes, this one confronts the need to overcome and accept the truth, instead of escaping to a blissful golden land when, really, you just died in a rather ugly way.\n\r\nBeyond probability and fantasy, beyond delusions and forgeries, this episode remains a search for a golden land which shouldn\'t, by all logic and reasoning, be allowed to exist. The last game isn\'t just a sibling dispute between Ange and Battler - it\'s a war between 1986 and 1998.\r\nAnd it\'s thrilling. \n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\r\nArt: 8/10\n\r\nComing fresh out of the other episodes, the difference in art style can be a little jarring... but if you\'re binging then you might not notice, considering that some earlier episodes had the same artist. Character designs are still on-point (i.e. seriously adorable, the hell is this), backgrounds are comfortable as usual (i.e. so much class), and the highlight of this episode is probably one of the most satisfying punches ever thrown.\n\r\nIt\'s the grand finale.\r\nIt\'s the return of cats and crazy frog eyes.\r\nThe art is as cutesy as it is psychotic, but I wouldn\'t have it any other way.\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\n\r\nThe hallmark of a strong cast is the potential for a thirty-page essay to be written about the characters alone. Nobody would read it if I wrote one, though.\n\r\nIn this episode, the spotlight returns to our favourite shredded meat girl. There\'s a comparison to a child soldier who marches in single-minded pursuit of an obsession, eventually left with nothing but themselves - well, that sums up Ange nicely. Her story reveals the dangers of a fixation with only cold, callous logic.\n\r\nThroughout the series, finding the truth of 1986 has meant rejecting all the fictitious fragments from the previous episodes. However, rather than rejection, this episode is a reconciliation between the witch of the future and the girl trapped in the past - and it\'s all tied to the idea that whatever lies on the jigsaw tiles isn\'t the whole truth. It\'s absolutely the truth, but there isn\'t just one truth.\n\r\nDon\'t understand? Ange doesn\'t either. That\'s where all the other characters come in, and how all of their arcs link together to present the truth that she needs, not just the one that she wants.\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Umineko really isn\'t 90% fiction and 10% truth - in a sense, everything is real. An emotion which is never conveyed can be truth, whatever the reality may be... and with that realization, the second central message hidden in each character\'s arc finally begins to make sense:\r\n""Without love, [the truth] cannot be seen.""\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\n\r\nHonestly, Umineko is a must-read for anybody who wants to spend their time thinking for far too long. Eva, Maria, Shannon; though their stories seem to be unrelated at first, by the end it\'s clear that they were wrapped in layers of o̶n̶i̶o̶n̶ allegory. Unlike this review, many of these ideas are actually digestible.\n\r\nFor instance, the idea that it takes two to complete a universe - it\'s like the concept of a catbox and an observer. A story can\'t be completed if the writer is the only observer; somebody whose work is never seen isn\'t an author.\r\nTo create a story, you only need a writer. To complete it, you need somebody else to act as a reader. Otherwise, who knows whether or not the story actually exists? Like Schrodinger\'s cat, the truth only exists within your catbox, not outside of it.\n\r\nExpanding on that idea of duality, this final arc of Umineko ultimately reveals that the entire series was not about a deathmatch between reality and fantasy, truth and lies, or love and hate - it was about reconciliation and acceptance.\n\r\nIt takes both truth and lies to approach the whole truth.\r\nIt takes a detective and a witch to protect a golden land.\n\r\n""Without love, the truth cannot be seen.""\r\n""Love is a source of madness which paints over the ugly truth.""\n\r\nAre these two statements truly incompatible? Given Battler and Beatrice\'s positions in this episode, along with their actions throughout the series - actually, aren\'t these two ideas the same thing? That complex symbolism, that dichotomy and contrast and battle between two extremes, is really what makes Umineko so great.\n\r\nIt takes two to complete a universe. After all\'s said and done, isn\'t that the true central message of this series?\n\r\nThere are innumerable stories (at least 8) which can be uncovered through inference and deduction, and though they should never be a replacement for reality, neither should they be ignored. The truth may be ugly, and it may be reprehensible. However, if it isn\'t shared, then it remains forever locked within the catbox... and the infinite possibilities which arise?\n\r\nThey form Umineko.']"

He&rsquo;s a street punk with piercings and bleached hair, a\n                  ...\ngraduate from a fifth rate university and was captain of his karate team. Not exactly what you would call teacher material. Despite all this Onizuka manages to convince the principal and gets a job as a teacher, he&rsquo;s assigned to class 4 who are notorious for having driven every homeroom teacher to insanity. However Great Teacher Onizuka isn&rsquo;t such a pushover and he&rsquo;s determined to win them over one by one. Onizuka stumbles from one mishap to another, saving kids from jumping off rooftops, reuniting them with their parents, just making a difference. Though this all may seem very trivial, this is the most amusing story I have read.\n\r\nMoving on to the art, the art is very detailed and nice to look at. It&rsquo;s got that 90&rsquo;s drawing style that I appreciate very much. However if it weren&rsquo;t for the characters different personalities you&rsquo;d have trouble telling them apart. Especially the girls all have somewhat the same face, and the only way you can tell them apart is by their hairstyle, which can be a bother sometimes. Overall there are quite some scenes were someone is standing on a rooftop looking over the city at dawn. It&rsquo;s these scenes that really get you into the art. Of course there are the infamous many faces from Onizuka that are just hilarious and make up for a lot.\n\r\nAbout the characters, I really like  the characters. I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with a few of them. But one thing bothers me.. They&rsquo;re supposed to be 14 years old, yet they&rsquo;re so darn evil. I remember being 14, I wouldn&rsquo;t go as far to torture a teacher as they would, then again they have their reasons. Moving on to the character Eikichi Onizuka. Quite simply he&rsquo;s one of the best characters ever created. He&rsquo;s an inspiration, he&rsquo;s cool, funny, stays true, and above all he&rsquo;s human (though this can be debated). Onizuka is one of  the most instantly likeable characters you will ever read about. If I were ever to sit down and have dinner with any character real or fictional, it would without a doubt be Eikichi Onizuka. Though I wouldn&rsquo;t be willing to pick up the bill.\n\r\nI cannot remember the last manga I enjoyed this dearly, I hold this manga close to heart and it is definitely one that I won&rsquo;t be forgetting. Hell I&rsquo;ll just say it, I&rsquo;m an Onizuka fan, and you could be too. Take it from me, reach deep in those pockets and get this manga, you won&rsquo;t regret it. And while reading you might even learn a thing or two from the greatest teacher in all of Japan, Great Teacher Onizuka.""]"
22,['3-gatsu no Lion'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/1224/3-gatsu_no_Lion,"['The failure of a sports manga, or a sports story, comes when the activity is segregated from human perception and life itself.\n\r\nThere’s one scene in the completely over the top TV series Aoi Honoo where Honoo realizes that the secret to Adaichi Mitsuru’s success as a sports writer was that he wasn’t writing sports manga at all – but school manga. This, to me, is the secret to making a sports story shine – the activity must be an excuse to develop human emotions, because this aspect is where it really sticks inside your head beyond the mere manipulation of parts.\n\r\nI find the same idea\n                  ...\napplies to mystery fiction, although a lot less people have opened up to this. The ingenuity of a trick is only one level, but when it becomes intertwined with heartfelt psychologies – like Isin’s mysteries or Hyouka – you have a way for the work to break its genre boundaries.\n\r\nGenre exists because people have realized that a certain kind of narrative structure can be abused to invoke certain pleasures inside a human being, and a limited genre writer is basically a person who sticks to a baseline abuse without allowing it to be seen in a different light. I’m not saying this is a bad thing though, since those who pull it off the best will be representative of the genre, but although they win over a certain segment of experience – they cannot ever develop a full scope of it.\n\r\n So mysteries would be abusive of the pleasure that one gets from a logical twist as well as fitting together disparate elements. Fantasy & Sci-Fi are abusive of the discovery of new worlds, ideas and cultures, while frequently forgetting that merely creating a new culture and explicating on it with high exposition is never going to ground it beyond anything other than a novelty. Slice of Life works on tranquility and nostalgia – but such a mood can be easily dissipated if it doesn’t allow for these moments to build upon one another. \n\r\nThe moment one extracts the core abstract concept of a genre – that allows for it to be broken and utilized, while still retaining the pleasures of the genre itself. This is the core strength of 3-Gatsu no Lion. Like Chihayafuru, it develops the community around the activity and focuses on the lives of these professionals who have devoted themselves to such a narrow scope of activity.\n\r\n3-Gatsu no Lion’s primary strength as a Manga, and maybe even moreso than Chihayafuru, comes from Umino Chika’s talent for characterization and the kind of sentimental poetic mood that fits Shoujo Manga so perfectly. This gives it that atmosphere of ‘life itself’ – something which may deflect many viewers from enjoying it fully, but gives a resoundingly good payoff should one understand what it’s building up to.\n\r\nA sign that this approach is working is when you look back upon a character and realize that this character has developed without you realizing it. Like life itself, you suddenly look back on yourself and you have the impression that you were still that person you were before, but somehow everything has been recontextualized – you become surprised at the change. The is more or less what it feels like to see the world through the eyes of Kiriyama Rei – and by the time he achieves his stability later in the manga and comes into his own, you cannot pinpoint any overtly specific moments of development – but can only ambiguously grasp that the accumulation of a variety of experiences has built up and stacked and multiplied themselves against one another to forge him anew.\n\r\nMore importantly, this change happens concurrently with the intersection of lives and other minds that populate the Shogi community Kiriyama is situated in, as well as the characters that inhabit his own personal life. This is vastly different with, for example, the kind of coming-of-age story that an author like Herman Hesse would write, whereby all the other characters serve as symbolic representations for the development of the protagonist (Hesse is still a good writer though, because of how well he does his style of plot).\n\r\nYou can see this development of a community in a similarity between Chihayafuru and 3-Gatsu. Both Manga are willing to take a break from focusing on the young, who are slowly coming into themselves, in order to focus on the struggle between veterans who are finding themselves displaced by the newer generations. This kind of focus on every age bracket and the overall community as a whole is the sign of a work that’s willing to build a larger universe of human feeling beyond its initial premises. Boku no Hero Academia is able to do this to a certain extent, but since it still has its Shounen battle roots to consider, it has yet to break out into a full examination of the community to the extent that something like 3-Gatsu has.\n\r\nAnd here is the clear difference between a work that is about ‘loads and loads of characters’ and a work that is about ‘loads and loads of lives’. One seeks to push them like pieces on a Shogi board, towards a certain goal, while the other is willing to take the time to deviate from the goal in order to give it greater meaning. This is a skill that has to be learned – the importance of pause, digression, and atmosphere in developing a story.']"

24,['Tian Guan Cifu'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/130826/Tian_Guan_Cifu,"['Spoiler free review (besides mentioning arcs if that counts for you)\r\nPreface: Before I start, I read this book in my first year of having chronic pain and it really helped me with the hardest months. So it’s going to be a fairly rose tinted review.\n\r\nStory:\r\nIt’s a character focused story, which I do have a liking for. But even I could see in retrospect, worldbuilding was lacking. I funnily liked the lack of any character development (maybe if you count the flashback arcs). Because it reads like you’re being put at the end of their whole life journeys even though they’re immortals. Romance takes a BIG\n                  ...\ncenter place over a lot and I’m not that ashamed to admit that I liked it. I’ve seen too many sad, short lived and out of focuse gay romance. It’s a enormous book, luckily I like big books but that has a lot of drawbacks for this particular story. Because there where many chances to make place for more established worldbuilding, unresolved character journeys. Looking at YOU black water arc! We were this close to perfection but no, we just got a impactful scene and none of the characters got a single moment to even reflect or process? Still one of the best arcs which stands out because the side characters and their journeys are a great selling point for this novel. \n\r\nBut you may ask me if have so many gripes with the story; why give it such a high score? Mainly because I like spending time with idealized depictions of romance and men in love with each other. The setting in ancient fantasy China. Their fluff and domestic moments are just so sweet and over top weird in an endearing way. I just couldn’t stop giggling. So hence the big score \n\r\nCharacters:\r\nI touched upon this one in the story part. XL and HC are not the best main characters, let’s be honest. XL is, sometimes, a bumbling buffoon who is ‘written’ as sharp, badly executed. I still kind of related with him, especially during book 2 & 4. Having that talented good (and privileged) start in life and beautiful ideals, only to fall miserably and try and fail a lot to get on the good path again and be a more humble person. And HC is annoying to everyone except XL for some reason, you can be neutral and have friends at least it. That doesn’t help him with seeming obsessed in a weird way, when you read it outside of context. But in my view the story makes it so it’s mostly justified. XL and HC are kind of overpowered, which is fine, but please have them struggle or have some flaws that get really in the way. Not just ‘haha I’m so bad at cooking look at me!’. \n\r\nHowever, I love the insights in the second, 4th book and side stories we get. They have enough dept for a blooming romance and being cute together. But for a novel like this drags it down in the other departments of MXTX’s storytelling here. The side characters are better written and fleshed out. Which is great! But when romance time is upon us, they get booted out. Shout out to Ling Wen and the Wind master. Just exceptional, we got some depth over here. Which XL and HC really need. Especially HC, I love the dude and his romantic gestures and quips. But… who are you and what do you contribute to the story besides being handsome and knowing really specific things when XL gets send on a mission. Would have loved some POV or even the man explaining himself some more.\n\r\nOverall:\n\r\nDespite many gripes, I loved the shit out of it and devoured it as if I haven’t eaten something all day. The characters should’ve gotten more fleshed out. I did love the romance so much! I enjoy big books so that’s always a win for me despite the flaws it can contribute to overall narrative. I like spending time with my cast of characters. That’s my justification. I’m making my way sort of backwards and am currently in book 3 of scum villain and I’ll read MDZS after. I can already see that her other work(s) have a more balanced narrative. Still TGCF will hold a special place in my heart for being some goofy fluff with some angst and helping me through my chronic pain and severe mental health issues I had back when I read it. I’d recommend this book to people who value a cute romance with cast of well written side characters. And for people who won’t take worldbuilding and background(stories) at a high level. Thumbs up from the hopeless romantic here!']"
25,['Koe no Katachi'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/56805/Koe_no_Katachi,"[""If you were a bully, would you try to change who you were? If you were a victim of bullying, would you forgive your assailant? Koe no Katachi (literally translated “The Shape of Voice” in English) by Ooima Yoshitoki details the story of Ishida Shouya, and his growth from a savage terror in elementary school, concerned only with satisfying his own need for stimulation, to a young man with concern and empathy for those around him.\n\r\nWe’re first introduced to Shouya as a child, performing a “test of courage” with his friends. You see, dear reader, Shouya is afraid of boredom. School is boring, stagnating is\n                  ...\nboring, living is boring, so he has to do something to cut through that cloud of drivel. What does he do? He jumps off of bridges. He pours salt on slugs. He eggs his two best friends on into getting into the same sort of trouble that he does. Shouya is a problem child, and this is made very clear from the very beginning of Koe no Katachi. When he meets Nishimiya Shouko, a deaf girl who transfers into his elementary school, he does not treat her like a person – he treats her like a tool to alleviate his boredom. He yells in her ear, pours dirt on her, and tosses out her hearing aids, not thinking for a moment that she is just another human being. No, she’s an alien from the planet Nishimiya, and she doesn’t understand human speech.\n\r\nStill interested in this manga? Hopefully, you are. The first part of Koe no Katachi is written so realistically that we can only feel hatred for Shouya as he goes through the motions of his existence. His behaviour toward Shouko and his sudden realization that what he has been doing is wrong is portrayed so masterfully as to be simply exceptional. This primarily unlikable child, Shouya, is the main character of this story, and this story is about his redemption as he transforms from a bully into a good human being. We watch him as he ruins his life, and we watch him try to build it back up again. His development is handled marvellously. His desire to better himself and help his mother (as well as Shouko, when he encounters her again later on) is commendable, and his ability to face the facts and stand his ground despite the shame and hatred he feels toward himself is nothing short of amazing.\n\r\nHowever, since Shouya is the narrator of our story, he is also an unreliable one. We don’t learn much about Shouko due to his influence. Now, some people may complain that it is because Shouko is poorly developed as a character. I disagree. I think it is more because we see Shouko through Shouya’s eyes, and Shouya himself doesn’t know very much about her. The only thing he can see is her expressions and what she says through her hands. That is all we can use to infer how she feels and what she thinks. And, for the most part, she is very expressive. It isn’t too difficult to guess what her emotions are based on the way her eyes blaze or which way her mouth curves – up or down. What about the more intricate thought patterns, you ask? Well, that’s all up to our own interpretation, and Shouya’s, too, which is where we begin making mistakes, and where the majority of the problems our hero faces stems from.\n\r\nWe have the same amount of information about the other characters in the manga (of which there are numerous), but these characters speak with their voices, which is why we find them to be more readily understandable (and Shouya as well, by extension). None of the characters fall into regular tropes such as tsundere or yandere – although it could be argued that Ueno has traits of both – and they all feel like very real people. They are likable and dislikable just like regular old individuals. Some of the most important characters we come across are Ueno Naoka, Kawai Miki, and Sahara Miyoko, all of whom were Shouya’s classmates when he was a child.\n\r\nUeno, at first, seems like a fairly pleasant girl, until we learn how bratty and spoilt she is. She joins right in with bullying Shouko, and indeed doesn’t seem to grow up, as she carries her hatred with her all the way into high school. While she is definitely a dislikable character, she is a well-crafted one. She understands her flaws and she wants to change who she is, but she doesn’t know how to and isn’t sure how to move forward. Moreover, her own motivations trump any sort of misgivings she has for her own behaviour, and while she may do a lot of things wrong, she also does some things right. She is forefront, honest, and blunt. She speaks her mind, and in some ways is a true driving force for the plot later on.\n\r\nKawai may be kawaii in appearance, but personality-wise she is anything but. Giving off the façade of a well-to-do honour student, Kawai breezes through life by doing whatever best benefits her and her vision of the world. While not as influential a character as Ueno, she certainly has her part to play in Koe no Katachi, as you’ll see once you read it. Sahara is a shy bookworm sort of character who warms up to Shouko the best in elementary school, although her attempts at making contact are ruined by peer pressure and psychological abuse. She is one of the characters who truly tries to make Shouya portray how much he has changed as a person.\n\r\nThe rest of the haphazard group is composed of Nagatsuka Tomohiro, Mashiba Satoshi, and Nishimiya Yuzuru. Nagatsuka wants to become a movie director, and his attempts at making a movie are what draw the characters together in the first place. Mashiba is one of the people Nagatsuka drags in to his dream. Yuzuru, meanwhile, is Shouko’s younger sibling, and enjoys taking pictures.\n\r\nNo character roster of Koe no Katachi would be complete without naming Shouko and Shouya's mothers. Both are very well designed characters, Nishimiya especially, and they both showcase different forms of love to their children.\n\r\nThis manga is riddled with hints, foreshadowing, and seemingly insignificant or confusing phrases and expressions. Certain heart-tugging events that may leave you stunned and at a loss for words may seem very natural and even inevitable when you take into account the main character’s lack of understanding of the situation and the cryptic messages we were privy to earlier. The second part of the manga, detailing Shouya’s growth as a person while he tries to make amends to Shouko, mixes the genres of drama, psychology, and slice of life together in a wonderfully immersive tale. The third portion of the manga is just as well-written, if more drama-filled than the relatively tame second part. Nothing changes the fact that the author seems to have a very good understanding of the mind. While she certainly could have made this manga darker, it is very good for what it is, and realistic enough that it doesn’t need anything more depressing to be considered a masterpiece.\n\r\nOoima Yoshitoki is a very good artist. Koe no Katachi has stellar art for a manga published on a weekly basis, with very few inconsistencies and no deterioration in quality that I have been able to notice. Both characters and backgrounds are detailed, and each character has a distinctive design to make them stand out from the rest. Characters are actually fairly realistic looking apart from Nagatsuka. Screentones are used to their full potential and there are definitely no cuts and corners taken when it comes to the artwork.\n\r\nWhat can I say about Koe no Katachi, in closing? It was certainly an amazing ride and I’m glad I came along for it. While it does have its issues here and there, one must take into account that this is the debut work of a very young author. It is truly an exceptional manga with the subject matter it tackles and the quality it is written, and I wholeheartedly label it a must-read for anyone interested in literature in general. Remember, kids, no matter what mistakes you’ve committed in the past, if you regret them and see them as they are, you’re a good person. Don’t be afraid of facing your fears, because that is only the first step of the journey you’re about to take. Growing up is a painful process – but we all have to do it. And at the end, you’ll reach a door. You know what you’ll find behind that door? Your future, yours to take into your own hands, as bright as you are able to make it. You can only help yourself as long as you are alive.""]"

27,['Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/89357/Youkoso_Jitsuryoku_Shijou_Shugi_no_Kyoushitsu_e,"['Welcome to Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School where we take in the most competent among the elite students for the sake of Japan\'s future. Or at least that was what the story was supposed to do. Instead, we are left with an incoherent group of students who competes for the title of Edge Lord.\n\r\n\tHonestly, I enjoyed Classroom of the Elite. This light novel series intrigued me enough to complete two volumes a day. I don\'t usually find stories set in school enjoyable, but this was indeed a page-turner. But although engaging, is the story in its\n                  ...\nentirety good? My answer would be no. My enjoyment is, after all, subjective, and not everyone would have the same experience. Enjoyment does not equal being objectively good, and it took me a while before I decided to write a review so I could remove any bias I may have. I don\'t want it to look like I dislike the story (Which I don\'t), so I\'ll say this now; this review is mainly criticizing the flaws of Classroom of the Elite. Spoilers are mentioned further in the review. \n\r\n\tThe story takes place in a school supported by the Japanese government to raise students to lead the country in the imminent future. Basically, a standard school\'s vision but put to the extreme. They don\'t accept students with academic superiority alone but students who are also competent in separate fields like judgment, physical ability, and cooperativeness. So everyone has a chance to enter the school. This sets up the first flaw, which is the students present in the institution. It just seems too easy to be accepted. Each year 160 students from Japan can enter the school, meaning that 160 out of millions of students in Japan are selected to enter the country\'s top school. This part makes me question why students like Ike, Sakura, and many others got accepted in the first place. With the school\'s standards, I can understand why Sudou got in and why students like Koenji and Horikita are in class D despite their overwhelming competence. But students with straight C\'s and even B\'s in all the fields by logic should not have passed the school\'s standards. Mediocrity being allowed in the country\'s best school doesn\'t make sense. It\'s the same flaw I find with My Hero Academia, with students like Mineta and Hagakure passing UA High school and in the hero course at that. It may look like I\'m nitpicking characters, but it\'s clear that students incompetent in all fields of ability are present in the institution. \n\r\n\tAfter passing the entrance exams and the interview, these said students are assigned to a class decided by their competence. Many institutions use this method in real life, but what makes this interesting is that this is the part of the narrative where the author associated the question involving equality, but inherently, does that even matter? Are the different classes representative of hierarchy? The higher classes as a representation of those with power and the lower ones as powerless? The first scene of the story shows an exchange of words showing a brief social commentary that explains the topic. However, once the story arrives at the school, it doesn\'t matter anymore or, at least, fails to bring correspondence. It\'s just a poor attempt to use the flawed school system and characters as an analogy of society.\n\r\n\tYes, the school is indeed flawed. Firstly, how rich is Japan? The school gives free money to the students each month and supplies the items in each store throughout the school, including an entire mall. Not to mention that the school hired all the employees for all the stores, owns crews ship, and gives extra class points and private points given as awards for tests.\n\r\n\tThe amount of money used for the school brings up another question; is the result worth it? Using this method to create ""Elites,"" I mean. Half of the graduates would probably just work jobs that ordinary graduates could do. With wasting millions of Yen on students\' allowance, billions or even trillions on infrastructure, employment, and miscellaneous. Japan is just going to add more to its debt before any of the students here makes a change for the country\'s economy. A competitive school environment where students are left to their own devices isn\'t needed to make these elites. If anything else, the white room seems to be a better place to use that money.\n\r\n\tLet\'s see, what else... A student council that has all power over the school, check; rules left with holes to be bent for the sake of the plot, check; that\'s about it, I suppose. Tell me if there\'s anything else I\'ve missed.\n\r\n\tNow for the characters. Firstly, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji; Arguably the only character worth criticism, but I\'ll still tackle the general cast later. Ayanokouji is portrayed as this super-genius, well-hung kid, but he chooses to hide his genius to fit in with the rest of the students and have an ordinary student life. In doing so, he purposely scored a half-perfect score in all subjects of the entrance exams and a few others after that. He should have at least tried to have an arbitrary set of scores for each subject so it wouldn\'t look painfully obvious. In addition, his scores would have been more believable if he hadn\'t answered the hard questions correctly while he answered wrong to some of the easy questions. In any ordinary school, his performance wouldn\'t have been that important. However, in his environment where competence is needed and filled, or supposed to be filled, with other geniuses, wouldn\'t appearing to be competent be a better way to not stand out?\n\r\n\tAyanokouji\'s initial motive was to live as an ordinary student, but this was interfered with due to being caught up in other people\'s business.  He got the attention of highly acclaimed students and competition, and Chabashira sensei threatened him to compete for class A. Of course, this could have been avoided if he didn\'t stand out too much due to his test scores and going overboard on special tests like the race with Manabu. That\'s all my criticism for our protagonist, everything else about his character is very thought out, especially his development in connotation to his past and initial personality, from a very apathetic person to slowly developing feelings for someone and accepting his friends. However, that does render his infamous monologue in volume three irrelevant. \n\r\n\tNow for the general cast. We have the perfect stereotypes to create a generic high school classroom. Sudo, A tuff guy who can\'t control his temper; Hirata, the class\' heart rob and representative; Kurizawa; an annoying girl who is in a ""relationship"" with the said handsome class representative; Suzune Horikita, the class genius; Kushida, our yandere with big fucking tiddies; girls in the ""hot girls"" clique, a few introverts, and a bunch of morons who have no significant qualities (As I have already mentioned, these idiots shouldn\'t even be in the school, to begin with). Also, why do some high school students look like divorced fathers in their forties? While generic, that doesn\'t mean all of the characters are inherently bad. There are a couple of exemptions; Sudou and Kurizawa. \n\r\n\tSudou\'s character is great to show the audience of the school\'s standards (If it wasn\'t for other idiots, at least). The school\'s description in the light novel places high emphasis on not accepting students who are only intellectually competent. In Sudou\'s case, it\'s his athletism that got him admitted. And his development on slowly improving his grades, whether having his motivation (Suzune) or not, makes him an even better character. I only have a couple of minor problems with his character, that would be that he was too dumb initially, and the other being his sudden affection for Suzune Horikita. I wish there could have been a gradual development to his feelings rather than ""If Ayanokouji doesn\'t like her, then I\'ll like her instead."" Kei is also a decent character, but that was only prominent after being Ayanokouji\'s tool. Loving someone she hated might seem like an overused cliché, but her relationship with Ayanokouji prior to the confession scene makes it work.\n\r\n\tDespite my criticism, I would actually like to recommend this to anyone, unless they absolutely hate edgy characters and pseudo-intellectual dialogue.

For those of you who enjoyed the movie (the film only barley skims the surface of the first and second volume), I highly suggest taking the time to finding the series and reading it, 7 volumes in all. \n\r\nNausicaä was written and illustrated by who may be one of the best filmakers of all time, Hayao Miyazaki. That alone should be an incentive enough, but the series itself is monumental. \n\r\nTaking place thousands of years in the future after all industrial life has come\n                  ...\nto an end, humanity is desperately trying to cling to life in a dying world where poisonous spores fall from trees daily and most are forced to wear masks. Different countries are always at war with each other, trying to scavenge the last of all resources. People turn to worship of bizarre and diverse gods all over the planet, not knowing where else to turn. A princess of one small village, the Valley of the Wind, fight's for her people's survival among invaders and gigantic, monstrous insects. Over the course of the story, the main character, Nausicaä, grows from an innocent, nature loving girl, one who has been hardened by death and loss, yet still manages to keep her peaceful persona and optimistic view. The story itself, besides the characters, is an adventure. The characters never stop to take a breath, always striving to keep humanity safe (sometimes from itself) and all the creatures of the world. All of this, paired with breath-taking artwork which defies the average manga style, makes Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind one of the most fantastic and epic mangas ever created.""]"
30,['Monogatari Series: Monster Season'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/108177/Monogatari_Series__Monster_Season,"[""4 arcs have been fan translated as of writing this, Shinobu Mustard, Mayoi Snail, Mayoi Snake, and Yotsugi Buddy. I plan to read Yotsugi Shadow and Ougimonogatari someday, since there are fan translations in Chinese, but this review shall only cover till Yotsugi Buddy.\n\r\nLet's cut to the case; how does Monster Season compare with the other Monogatari seasons?\n\r\nif I had to rank all of them, it would be like: 2nd>Off>1st>Final>Monster. \n\r\nNow granted I have not read all of Monster Season, and who knows, Monster season might somehow rise up the ranks and become the 2nd best season or something (2nd season is untouchable), however I'm\n                  ...\nfeeling pretty confident on where Monster season is heading, or at least the sort of setting and tone of it. (Of course, knowing NisiOisin he might just flip the board and shatter all my expectations)\n\r\nMonster Season takes place after Off season, in which Koyomi Araragi is now a college student. Yes, Mr Muraragi has finally graduated from high school, and is now somewhat of a grown up. The overarching theme of Monster season lies in the concept of Adulthood, and what it means to Araragi. It's certainly a very different shift of themes compared to the prior seasons' focus on Adolescence, but it's interesting to see Araragi continue his lifelong struggle of saving girls with issues with his status as an adult.\n\r\nAnd yes, Monster season does feel like Bakemonogatari once again. Whereas Second season went off the rails and focused on the Araragi harem, and the final season focused on Oshino Ougi shinnenigans, Monster season feels like a return to the form of the original premise of this series. Shinobumonogatari has obvious parallels with Kizumonogatari even beyond surface level examination, Yoimonogatari has elements of Tsubasa Family etc, it's once again back to Araragi solving girls issues.\n\r\nThis time, the focus is on other girls. Yes, it sounds incredible, but Monster season decides to introduce new characters to its already pretty big roster of girls. However, it's obvious that NisiOisin doesn't want to allocate too much time on fleshing out these characters, which sounds like a bad thing but honestly isn't so in my eyes, since stealing screentime from preexisting characters to promote a new wave of girls would obviously backfire on Nisio this late into the series. They're more of plot devices than actual characters, but that's not too bad of a thing itself.\n\r\nLet's talk more about these girls shall we, since Monogatari is ultimately a harem, or a harem-bait. Whatever.\n\r\nThere's a codebreaker college classmate Araragi befriends, though I'll be real she doesn't do jackshit other than a MacGuffin for Araragi to find clues. Kanbaru's friend who appeared in Hanamonogatari is also a recurring character throughout the season. I find her too similar to Kanbaru, and hope that Nisio branches her out from her pervy kouhai shtick. \n\r\nThe new main characters, basically the girls Araragi saves in the season, are all one-shot. They don't appear after their arcs, since Monster season is an Araragi-centric season.\n\r\nAs I said, there isn't much to talk about these new characters. They're necessary so that readers will feel that Araragi is finally stepping out of his comfort zone and meeting new people, but not important enough to justify long page lengths of random banter to flesh them out.\n\r\nOur lovely original harem also has their time to shine too. Shinobumonogatari, obviously has quite a lot of fun Shinobu moments in it, Yoimonogatari has Hachikuji doing God things, and Amarimonogatari has Ononoki tagging along. They aren't necessarily the main stars of their arcs, but they do have their scenes. We also get more of Gaen Izuko, and it's always fun to know more about the specialists. \n\r\nHowever by far the most important character after Araragi HAS to be Nadeko. \n\r\nNadeko fans who are anime onlys, I beseech you, read Off season and Monster season. Nadeko feels like the deuteragonist of Monogatari, with her development and growth being such a joy to watch. Whereas Second season completely destroys and deconstructs Nadeko as a character, Off and Monster season builds her back up. It is extremely satisfying to read, and her personality is far more appealing now than ever before. She also works really well with other characters like Ononoki, Tsukihi and Hachikuji, which is funny because I've always cited Nadeko as the weakest link all the way back in first season. I'm glad NisiOisin proved me wrong. Monster season continues Nadeko's journey, and from the glimpses of Shinomonogatari it seems like she'll meet best grill Kaiki once again, which is extremely welcome.\n\r\nOn to the plot. Monster Season is very much mystery centred. The three books, Shinobumonogatari, Yoimonogatari and Amarimonogatari are of...varying quality. I'll start with the worst: Amarimonogatari. \n\r\nNow I haven't finished the un(English)translated Yotsugi Shadow, and who knows maybe it's so good it changes my opinion, but as of now, Amarimonogatari is probably the weakest after Koyomimonogatari. It's not bad by any means, just bland. Ononoki is fun, however she honestly can't carry the arc with her banter with Araragi. The Ononoki-Araragi pairing is fun in small bites, but stretched to one entire arc it's a bit stale. The mystery is interesting, however the themes are rather similar to the previous two books and it's not that entertaining either. I would probably adore this book if we actually got Sodachi somehow roped into this, but nope. Overall, an alright arc. It's far from the highs of Monogatari, but it's not offensive or a waste of time either.\n\r\nShinobumonogatari is pretty good. It's the first of the season, laying down a lot of the grounding for the tone of the season, and it does it quite well. It's nice seeing callbacks to Kizu, entertaining with its assortments of appearances from the likes of Suicidemaster, Gaen Izuko etc. Also, seeing Araragi solve issues not by charging headfirst recklessly like in the first 3 seasons but by actually considering and judging his actions makes me extremely proud of him. Overall, it's fun, with a nice message and character development of our protagonist.\n\r\nYoimonogatari is amazing. This is one of the best books in this series easily, and this is the same series with installments like Koimonogatari and Otorimonogatari. The mystery is very compelling, the narrative paced well, the message is refined and clear, seeing Araragi make up of sorts for his quite terrible handling of Hanekawa's situation is interesting, and the emotional moments are very touching. There are a lot of genuinely gripping and beautiful moments in this book, making it one of my absolute favourites. There's twists and turns, fun banter, a great mystery, and a very important message, what more could you want from Monogatari?\n\r\nIn conclusion, Monogatari Monster Season is very solid. As a monogatari fan, it gave me quite a lot of enjoyment. If you like the mystery aspect of monogatari, you would love this season. The score might increase once I finish this season, but as of now, it is an 8/10. It's a sort of End Story Sequel, except an entire season, for the grand narrative of Monogatari. I highly recommend it to any Monogatari fans.""]"
31,['Ookami to Koushinryou'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/9115/Ookami_to_Koushinryou,"[""Simplicity can sometimes produce the best results, and that is especially true for this light novel.\n\r\nPeople who have heard of Spice and Wolf have probably seen the anime and may not even know it was based off a light novel or have not given thought to read the light novel from which the story originated. However, this novel is a very enjoyable read and can easily get people engrossed in the story. \n\r\nWhen I first bought this novel I did it because I really wanted to know what happened next after the end of the anime series. I really enjoyed the series and the way\n                  ...\nSpice and Wolf II ended, it just made me want more. As soon as I began reading this novel, I was caught in the web that was spun by this book and I simply did not want to put it down.\n\r\nI don't need to introduce the story but from just reading the synopsis it might appear to be rather boring. Not only from the synopsis but this book deals with many forms of economics as well as politics and of course the relationship between Holo and Lawrence. You might think that if it deals with Economics and politics of the 14th century Europe ( or whatever time frame) this would be rather uninteresting, I say this because I thought that. However, upon reading it when the economics parts came up I found them to be very entertaining. \n\r\nThe only way I could think of it is what if someone took a good story and put in some historical facts and details amongst the story and made you feel like you were learning something. I was surprised at myself because I would be reading of Lawrence trading and cutting deals with businesses and I would be totally invested into the story. I believe how it manages to still be interesting is how the author writes the book, the way things flow together and correlate makes for a good read.\n\r\nAlthough, the most interesting aspect of this series is the relationship between Holo and Lawrence. It was funny, heartwarming, and even sad to see what happens between these two. To see Lawrence change little by little and see the same for Holo is great. Seriously this is the reason to read this series, the way they interact is very unique. Holo may be able to be categorized, but she makes this category of her own, if nothing else.\n\r\nHolo teases but is never mean, she cries but is never weak. She is what I would imagine a 400+ year old Human/Wolf would act like (I don't remember hold old she is supposed to be so don't fault me for a random age guess). More over, sometimes I feel that in anime female characters tend to be cut and paste, and the ones that are different are unrealistic. However, with Holo it was different. She is rather human to me, which may seem odd to say, but I could easily see someone acting like she does and because of that this book was much more enjoyable.\n\r\nHowever, Lawrence is like a man caught between a rock and a hard place. He makes a promise to a woman but he doesn't know if he can keep it. He wants to keep the promise but he realizes he might have to give up his dream. If he forgoes his dream he might be disappointed in the end. But, its how he changes that makes him such a good character. He starts out like a man only out for himself and money and over time changes and his priorities begin to change. I always felt bad for Lawrence for all the teasing he gets from Holo but, it was a very good humor addition to the story.  \n\r\nTo see these two interact with each other is a treat indeed. Because, like I said, their relationship is the main reason to read this. \n\r\nThis series is two people from completely different worlds finding that common ground and making a special bond out of it. I have many more volumes to read in the series but I feel that so far this series is definitely worth your time!\n\r\nFEEDBACK: I would definitely appreciate feedback, it would help me to become a better writer.\n\r\nEDIT: revised 11/26/11, 1/3/12""]"
32,['Akatsuki no Yona'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/21525/Akatsuki_no_Yona,"[""first review :) *minor spoilers but isn't that important*\n\r\nStory: \r\n- Though the introduction & plot of the story seems kind of boring and almost generic, as you read further into the manga you won't even consider it boring. It starts out with a weak princess, Yona, and while others won't even bother touching a manga with this type of female protagonist, surrounded by many other men of her own harem, Yona actually puts up a name for herself. Yona gets stronger overtime because of her own determination and will to, which I really give respects to her for. As the story progresses, the story introduces\n                  ...\nmore characters that will accompany Yona and her bodyguard Hak, as they roam the lands of Kouka together. 9.5/10\n\r\nArt:\r\n- Mizuho Kusanagi certainly doesn't disappoint when it comes to the art style with Akatsuki no Yona. She makes it so that the historical part of the series also ties into the art work with its abstract, marvelous designs with building structures, statues, clothing, etc. The art is interesting, and I really love how Mizuho will put in amazing designs in certain parts of the story that isn't necessary to the story at all. Mizuho is perfect for drawing details, no page in Akatsuki no Yona isn't beautifully done. 10/10\n\r\nCharacters:\r\n- My favorite part about Akatsuki no Yona. The unique and different amount of characters there are in the manga! Each of the main characters have their backgrounds, and where they all came from. Everyone has different personalities, but they all have personalities to where you will just like them all. The character development for Yona is outstanding. Her journey from being a spoiled princess who always got anything she wanted to a more stronger person who works to get what they want and help the people in need around her is amazing. My favorite dragon is Hakuryuu, Kija, because I really love the comedy he brings into the group as well as his loving loyalty to Yona. Romance between Yona & Hak is very sweet too, why can't they just get married already ? Everyone has their own humor that I personally enjoy; the characters never bore me. 10/10\n\r\nEnjoyment:\r\n- It takes a lot for me to go ahead and read a manga, I would rather see things in color and sometimes reading and seeing black and white over and over again starts irritating my eyes. Even then, I highly enjoy Akatsuki no Yona. This is my favorite manga. This manga has never made me uninterested, I always loved how it can be very serious, the dialogue being very story heavy to a more light-hearted atmosphere in the next page. The transitions from serious to comedy is driven out very well, the jumps don't really feel so sudden, it felt like it was natural for it to be there. I love each and every one of the character's for a lot of different reasons, and a lot of different reasons because they have so much behind them. I liked, loved this manga for the art work, characters, meaning, how the characters interacted with each other, how the arcs were presented, just pretty much everything! I hope Akatsuki no Yona won't stop publishing for a few more years, and I also hope that the anime for Akatsuki no Yona will finish off excellently and someday receive a season two (by the time the anime ends, there will be a lot more stuff that didn't get animated, so pray for season two!) 10/10\n\r\nOverall:\r\n- Overall, this manga is a 10/10 for me; if you are a person who is interested in the historical fantasy aspect in stories as well as romance, comedy, and action then this manga is practically calling out to you! Keep in mind though that this is a shoujo and a reverse harem, but don't let those two change your mind on possibly reading this. Every male in the reverse harem will make you like this series, and Yona herself, of course.""]"
33,['Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/70261/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu,"['WARNING: This novel contains mature content and many plot twists!\n\r\n""This time I\'ll really live my life to the fullest with no regrets!"" -Rudeus Greyrat\n\r\nNormally, a review that is written before the manga/novel is finished should be considered incomplete. Having a review written when it lack of information lacks credibility and is unable to judge the worth of the entire story. I wrote this review because the current reviews do not give the novel justice as they\'re all reviews with a similar point of view. Noticing the lack of variety I decided to post my own review which will side with the other half of the\n                  ...\nreaders (and hopefully future readers). I also would like to note that Mushoku Tensei isn\'t one that needs to be complete to be able to understand how amazing the novel is.\n\r\nStory: 10\r\nUpon the first volume you will immediately realize this novel is a 10. Mushoku tensei is a very entertaining and extremely detailed novel. I felt as if I was immersed in to the world that Rudeus was experiencing, whether it be the hardships he may be facing or his interaction with the other characters. Often times Rudeus is forced to make difficult decisions, which always leaves you wondering what happens next? After reading the first novel you can tell immediately the amount of effort the writer used to allow the readers to understand visually how amazing and captivating this world truly is. There are also many plot twist which are extremely surprising (BEWARE MANY ATTEMPT TO SPOIL THIS STORY FOR OTHERS!), without a doubt the story is extremely detailed and has many different stand points from multiple events which allows you to understand how each character feels during the events because the author takes the time to write in different perspectives.\n\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe novel didn\'t come with many images (I believe there is none after volume 6) this is quite disappointing but it\'s not a big deal (you can check the manga for reference images). The art I\'ve seen so far seems to really suit the novel and it really brings the environment and the characters to life. The one thing that I really loved about this novel is how the author provided a map. Yes a map of the entire world which is extremely helpful and interesting to look at especially for reference during Rudeus\' adventure.\n\r\nCharacters: 9\r\nThe author allows you to see how the main characters grow and change. Although the protagonist Rudeus has lived about 30 years in his previous life there are MANY times he is still learning and changing, this allows for interesting plot points where his knowledge in his past is both useful and at the same time useless. The characters you meet in the novel seem really static, but without realizing I noticed the characters really changed. The changes are really subtle that they feel as if they happen immediately, but you have to think back to the previous chapters to notice the gradual change. There are minor and or major events that occur, where each event that happens reveals a little more about a certain character. NOTE: This is because the author writes the story from 1-3 peoples perspective, which allows us to be able to understand the characters thought process through each event. Keep in mind although he writes it in a different perspective it isn\'t as if it\'s a complete repeat of what happened, he usually gives a 1-3 summary, then quick thoughts about what happened and then moves on with the story, sometimes continuing from the prospective or changing to another.\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\r\nWithout a doubt this has to be a 10. I love this novel. A good phrase for this would be ""never a dull moment"" because that’s how i felt when I was reading this. This novel is really entertaining and I highly recommend it to those who have the spare time whether it is before sleeping or while taking public transportation. \n\r\nOverall: 10\r\nHere is the part where I persuade you in to reading the novel. I found the novel an easy read something that anyone can pick up. The content is mature and isn\'t intended for younger readers. There are many points that happen to leave the reader thinking WHY DIDN\'T YOU DO THIS OR THAT, but it all happens for a reason. Thanks to the great details provided by the author, I was never left in a situation where I had to wonder why a situation occurred. Everything that was shown was thoroughly explained which I loved since often times in many novels I\'m left with why, what or how...? I rarely read novels because I normally prefer manga\'s but if you\'re like me and you want something that is amazingly detailed with how the characters are and how their thought process is this novel is meant for you. The novel sells through its characters, meaning that if you don\'t like the characters then you\'re likely to dislike the novel.\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\r\nAlthough it would be extreme to say this manga is the best, but it isn\'t one that you will regret reading. I\'m often in a situation where I have to choose between finding out the rest of the novel or just do some plain ol\' studying (easy choice novel of course). I highly recommend this novel to everyone to at least give it a chance, there are MANY volumes out already so there is more then enough plot to go around.']"
34,['86'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/104039/86,"['This ""Review Contains Spoilers"" (This review will always be reissued over time)\n\n\r\n86 has everything  like to read, for example: Mecha, Action, Romance The story deals with very interesting subjects, such as: racism, authoritarianism, fascism, discrimination and reference to what happened in the Second World War. \n\r\nThe 86-District / are any other minority considered inferior by the Republic were systematically grouped, exploited to exhaustion and then summarily executed or forcibly sent to the battlefield to fight “The unmanned‘ Legion ’army of the Empire. Eighty Six, It was the last outpost that the Republic (the humans) stayed in when the “Legion” swept the continent - Only\n                  ...\npigs that look like humans remained in the non-human area (area eighty-six) behind the eighty-five legislated areas . “Colorata”, this is the derogatory term used for people who are not citizens of the Republic (Albas), they lived as citizens of the Republic, but are considered inferior to humans by their own countries, they live outside the shelters, outside the Grand Mur and are always on the front lines. \n\r\nNine years ago. Year 358 of the Republic calendar, Year 2139 of the Anno Astrum. The northern country of the continent, the Gead Empire, which borders the eastern part of the Republic, declared war. The first wave of completely unmanned combat drones started the invasion. Faced with the overwhelming force of the military superpower Geade, the Orthodox Army of the Republic collapsed in just half a month. At that time, the military brought together all its men, and started with the tactic of demoralizing and delaying the enemy army, in the meantime the government of the Republic made two decisions. The first: Evacuate all citizens of the Republic to the eighty-five legislated areas. The other was to initiate presidential order 6609, the special wartime security law. This law meant that all Coloratas (Jews) (those who were not Albas = Nazis) residing in the Republic were considered as enemies allied to the Empire. So they lost their citizenship, and then they were sent to concentration camps outside the eighty-five areas where they are always monitored, that is, only those who live in area 86. Eighty-six. -That was certainly a betrayal of the legislation and the very meaning of the five-color flag that the Republic is so proud of. Any and all Colorata born in the Empire, except the Albas, began to be treated like animals and to be arrested, this was a very blatant form of discrimination and prejudice. Naturally, the Coloratas protested. However, the government silenced them using force. There were also some Albas who protested. However, most Albas supported this idea. They said that the Coloratas were not satisfied with the resources, land or positions they had. The rumors that the Coloratas were spies were much easier to accept than the sad reality that the country was left behind in terms of military technology. And with enemy forces increasingly leaving the Republic with no way out, humans needed scapegoats to discount their anger and resentment. And so then, racial supremacy instantly gained recognition and justification. The noble and humane first modern Republic in the world, ended up recognizing only the Albas as human, while all the Coloratas of the old-fashioned and inhuman Empire were considered inferior, were considered foolish and barbaric animals that only had the appearance similar to that of humans, but that failed to evolve to the human stage. All the Coloratas were sent to concentration camps and were forced to serve in the army, they who built the walls of the fortress. All the assets and properties of the Coloratas were confiscated and appropriated by the government of the Republic, meanwhile citizens praised the human government for letting them not go into the army, nor having to work or pay additional taxes even in times of war.\n\r\nDiscrimination against the Coloratas and the Eighty Sixers (considered inferior) began to occur among the Albas two years after it started. The soldiers were all composed of Eighty Sixers members, and all of those soldiers who were active were sent to the battlefields inside drones. -The Eighty Sixers joined the army because they and their families would receive Republican citizenship. Due to the great racism in all eighty-five areas, in the past nine years, since the beginning of the war it has never been revealed where they lived. However, probably many of them have returned to their old homes, where they spend all their days. -The Geade Empire, being a military and technological power, abused this philosophy and developed advanced technologies, and with that, created devastating weapons and incredible drones. They developed an artificial intelligence superior to any created in their time, an intelligence that would never be tired, irritated or terrified, since there was no human piloting them. No matter how many were destroyed, the factories were fully automated and located in hard-to-reach places on the land, the factories spit machines over and over, forming a large swarm of drones.\n\r\nIn the case of Jews / lower races in Germany, the first moment of this whole extermination process was through hate speech. The rhetoric against them was strengthened in the post-First World War when Germany was embarrassed and made them the scapegoats for German defeat. All sorts of conspiracy theory came to be distilled against the Jews, and when the Nazis came to power, the speech became action.\r\nSo the Jews were expelled from public service, then their stores were boycotted and attacked.\n\r\nPersecution in the streets increased considerably, and cases of physical violence began to happen. Afterwards they were forbidden to marry non-Jews, citizenship requests for foreign Jews were denied, and German Jews were stripped of their citizenship.\r\nJews were deprived of their freedom and all rights as citizens. When the war started, the Nazis intensified the theft of their property and began to group it in ghettos.\n\r\nThe acts of the Republicans are very similar to those of authoritarian governments and today we can see that there are still those types of governments / countries in which they still have the same racist thinking and we see that humanity has not evolved at all, and that there are still people who idolize such ideas. 86 is a criticism of how governments like that are a mere idiocy of the human being and who suffers is the population of good who is at the mercy and without freedom to express themselves, not only the population but other races.\n\n\n\n\r\n86 is undoubtedly one of the best or if not the best thing I have read during these years, and I always wanted to do something like that [write about].\n\r\nVolume 1 is super well written with wonderful plots and not counting the main characters Shin / Lena, but it still ends up sinning even if it is a little in the secondary characters (although they are charismatic), I know they had a little development up to the volume current [V6]. But I still think that they were little explored until that time of the championship or it could be that in the next volumes [7,8 and 9] they may have an extra highlight.\n\n\r\n""No country will mind giving human rights to pigs.

35,['Nana'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/28/Nana,"[""NANA is definitely one of the best mangas that I've ever read. There's something about it that makes it very different from other ones, so I personally think it's a must-read. Anyways, my review may contain some spoilers, but I'll try my best not to reveal too much.\n\r\nStory- 10\r\nThe first thing that comes to mind when I think of NANA is how incredibly realistic it is compared to many other mangas. It starts out very normal like any other shoujo/josei manga; introducing the two main characters who both happen to have the name Nana. It pretty much follows the life of these two girls as\n                  ...\nthey meet on a train to Tokyo, and then later decide to share an apartment. It may sound a bit dull and boring, but the story always draws you in and makes you wonder what would happen next. Personally what I think is best about the story is the realistic aspect of it, since I've always loved serious and realistic mangas/animes. After reading so many silly mangas with unrealistic story plots, I found it very refreshing to read something completely different. In fact, it's so realistic to the point that I find myself wishing that it wouldn't be so realistic, since NANA definitely isn't your happily ever after story. \n\r\nArt- 7\r\nWell, I hate to say this but the art of NANA isn't the best. It's not that the mangaka is a bad artist or anything, but the style of NANA just doesn't appeal to me very much. I also don't really like how some of the backgrounds seem as if they are a completely different style of art. Sometimes it looks as if the characters are standing in front of some wallpaper rather than in the actual place so that kinda bothers me. On the other hand, I love how much detail the mangaka puts in the characters and their clothes.\n\r\nCharacter- 10\r\nI'm not giving this section a 10 because I think all the characters are perfect and love them all to death, but rather because there is at least one thing I don't like about almost all the characters. That may sound weird, but the reason why I like it is because of how realistic it makes them and how it makes you able to relate to them very easily. I can easily imagine all the characters being real people, and almost all of them are very well developed. Another thing I like about the manga NANA is how the mangaka isn't afraid to put in traits like selfishness and possessiveness and have the characters realize those traits in themselves. I don't think I've ever read another manga that had that, so I was pretty impressed when I first read those parts.\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\r\nI really don't have much to say here...all I have to say is that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this.\n\r\nOverall- 9\r\nOkay, I'll just be repeating myself here if I say how much I enjoyed it, so I'll just add a few things here that I didn't put up here. So another thing I like about NANA is how it makes you think a bit about life in general. The things that the characters say sometimes made me realize some stuff, and now because of NANA I think I can understand people a bit better. :3 \n\r\nRecommendation-\r\nI recommend this manga to people who like realistic plots that have a bit of humor in it. But if you're someone that likes fairy tail plots, happily ever afters, perfect princes/princesses, or couples that have no problems then this definitely isn't the manga for you. And it's also for an older audience so please don't read it if you're really young. o3o""]"

The story is very slow to progress. In fact, 15 volumes in, and questions we’ve been asking since chapter 1 have yet to be answered. On the contrary, it is at a faster pace that\n                  ...\nmore questions are added than answered. However, that’s not to say that it wastes time or fails to provide information.

You may get impatient, and you may facepalm in disgust, but there are real consequences for his personality failures, and like anyone who grapples with their own shortcomings, he will struggle and adjust in order continue on for himself and the people he cares for. Be ready to suffer and struggle with him. He very much progresses from the person he starts out being.\n\r\nThe other characters naturally endure their own faults. However, that does not necessarily mean you won’t find them charming or enjoyable. Re:Zero does a very good job with showing how changes in environment or knowledge can alter a character’s reactions and priorities. It fleshes out the supporting characters’ dispositions, and allows the reader to truly understand who they are and why.\r\nThere are exceptions to this, but for the most part, every character introduced in the story is cherished by the author, and breathed life into.\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\n\r\nPersonally, I very much prefer concise stories with dissimilar arcs and zero fluff. So it’s a testament to Re:Zero’s ability to maintain the flow of itself over its many volumes that I find such a slow progressing story to be the #1 most enjoyable in my collection.\r\nI’ve chuckled, I’ve cringed, I’ve cried many times, I’ve had my perceptions changed, and Re:Zero constantly reminds me that it’s not afraid to rob me of what I expected to be a happy ending.\r\nIt is addictingly refreshing, and I’ve yet to find anything which can satisfy me in the same way.""]"

Well I can tell you that you can find beautiful hidden gems like this. Currently ranked in the top 50s, at first I thought it was “overrated” like many others. I was wrong. Completely.\n\r\nThis manga is probably one of the best presentations of the harsh world we live in. The expectations from people for someone to achieve certain goals. The false hope that ""something good"" may happen at some point. The realization of the hidden thoughts of those around you.\n\r\nAlthough it is relatively short, this is a very unique manga,\n                  ...\nexploring the value of one\'s life in real money. Intricately planned, it shows how predicting one\'s life\'s value can change greatly. The protagonist has lost everything, including friends, money, hobby... And by selling 30 years of his life, he gets 30,000 yen to spend for the 3 months remaining in his life.\n\r\nUsually you would expect the protagonist in a story to improve from how he/she was at the start, to realize and learn his/her mistakes. Or something along those lines. But this is different. Our protagonist has already lost all meaning in life. What he expected to be a rich, vibrant future from when he was 10 years old has turned into a complete disaster. With a boring part-time job and no money... What does he have left to lose when he gets this chance to sell his lifetime and end it early? \n\r\n""You\'ve all been told that it\'s something that can\'t be replaced, and that it\'s more valuable than anything. But if a human life were given a monetary value, how much do you think it would be worth?""\n\r\nThis question is basically what the manga is about. It\'s not whether putting a value is right or not. Rather, it\'s about how each person would perceive this question depending on what point in their life they are in. It all depends on who you\'re asking. I think this is the most intriguing part of this work. \n\r\nSo why is his ""value of life"" so low? Borrowing words from the manga, is it really something that depends on ""how happy a life it is, how it makes others happy, how many dreams are achieved, how much it contributes to society...""? Another question which is hard to answer. Again, it depends on who you ask. The ambiguity of the value of life can sometimes lead to shocking results. Perhaps it is a warning for us to look at ourselves first, instead of pitying or being annoyed by the protagonist’s nihilistic personality.\n\r\nOverall, the development is very good, perfectly paced throughout the manga and every scene seems to have a deep meaning within.\n\r\nWhile I read this, I felt as if you could put almost any value to life. The manga wasn\'t detailed enough in terms of how they give an exact value for one\'s life. Maybe it\'s just me but the shop buying lifespan in itself really was a very disturbing existence. How could you put a number just by knowing some info about a person\'s life? I guess that depends on how you see life, whether every moment should be cherished or only certain moments should.\n\r\nI just can\'t say how amazing this is... And yet so few people have read it. This is beyond a masterpiece, there\'s a lot to take in and it really goes in to the basic meaning of life itself. Although for some people this may be boring, with a simple change to make selling lifespan real, the author comes up with this great work. An obvious 10 out of 10.']"

40,['Kokou no Hito'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/7375/Kokou_no_Hito,"[""The saying ‘’A picture paints a thousand words’’ is truly exemplified by this manga. While the amount of dialogue in-series isn’t exactly low, the main character speaks rarely throughout the whole manga; yet that is its biggest feat. While manga, like anime, is a visual medium, most works don't utilize their visuals to full extent, only going as far as to present scenarios in a very bare-bones and basic manner. That's where Kokou no Hito shines, as it manages to tell the story solely through its astonishingly utilized visuals - be it the visualization of psychological struggle or metaphorical imagery that adds a symbolic layer\n                  ...\nto the scenarios that our protagonist faces.\n\r\nI think it should first be mentioned that expecting a traditional sports manga when going into it is a mistake; the series is more akin to titles like Ping Pong, where the actual sport takes a backseat to the exploration of the cast. Yet Kokou no Hito is different in a way, since the whole manga focuses on Mori Buntarou’s mentality, and his alone. Our protagonist is shy by nature, and soon after transferring schools, he gets into mountain climbing - this is a rather traditional setup, but that’s not all there is to it. \n\r\nInitially, Sakamoto Shinichi was responsible for the artwork whereas Yoshiro Nabeda was responsible for the writing - a fairly common constellation for serializations; but due to, at least to me, unknown circumstances, Yoshiro Nabeda left the project after volume 3, and Sakamoto Shinichi was now not only the illustrator, but the author as well. I believe this worked to the series’ benefit - the first two volumes were rather clichéd in their structure, but once Sakamoto Shinichi took over the writing, the series evolved; turning over from a traditional sports series to an atmospheric, introspective character study. \n\r\nThat’s where the visuals get important - while in most cases, characterization is done through dialogue and actions, Kokou no Hito does it through the art; since Mori fails to talk back to people due to his shyness, and is reluctant to talk in general, his personality and mindset are brought forward solely by metaphors. Instead of just blandly showing us his inability to reply, his thought process is visualized; to provide an example, in an instance where a character stubbornly demands Mori’s keys, Mori fails to deny the request and simply stands there, awestruck - yet what is actually shown to us is Mori pointing a remote at her trying to metaphorically “turn her off”, followed by him sitting on the floor writing possible replies on notes. This impressively conveys his struggle to find the right words and him wanting to escape the situation. And yet Mori, in reality, just stands there doing nothing. This was just one of numerous examples, and the series truly makes successful use of this technique. Kokou no Hito also utilizes its art to create a fitting atmosphere - be it landscape shots from the mountain-top to create a sense of irrelevance and scale or small moments like Mori breathing in fresh air and simply feeling alive. Although it is perfectly utilized, the atmosphere creates an issue within the series - since the writer changes, the tone of the series alternates rather abruptly; this causes the transition from volume 3 to 4 to be rather jarring, and can break the built up immersion in the previous volumes, although I personally am able to overlook that since once you get used to the new direction it takes, it becomes a way more captivating series.\n\r\nThe change in author also caused several subplots to be scrapped, and some characters that were planned to be relevant later on were treated very poorly by the plot; this feels especially odd considering the level of insight the series gives Mori and its thematic exploration, creating a stark contrast between the very well crafted and almost amateurishly written sides of the series. That does not mean the series goes downhill though, as it manages to create several compelling subplots and exciting twists - since this series is about mountain climbing, an inherently dangerous activity, there are bound to be fatalities, and the way the series portrays the cruel apathy of nature is truly chilling; people die on several occasions throughout the series, yet those deaths are not dramatized in the slightest, rather, they are presented to be natural events, which makes those moments even more haunting and depressing. This ties really well into the series’ theme of human irrelevance to nature, how small and meaningless we are in the grand scheme of things. The manga addresses this in an intriguing way, presenting the mountain and the act of climbing as both a strenuous and demanding, yet desirable and fulfilling thing; throughout his journey Mori faces many challenges and cruelties in the mountains, yet he never backs down, always chasing one peak after another - he doesn’t have any concrete reason, the only thing he knows is that it gives him a sense of liberty, being isolated from the humans he does not get along with.\n\r\nThe aforementioned ties profoundly into the series’ symbolism, most notably the meaning of the mountain and the rope. Whereas the mountain’s symbolic meaning is vague, the rope’s is pretty simple and straightforward - human connection. Once you link ropes with a climbing partner, your life lies in their hands and theirs in yours. If one falls, both die; severing the rope means severing your connection to another human, and that theme is poignantly presented in Kokou no Hito. The mountain’s meaning deserves more focus than I can give in this review.\n\r\nA big criticism this series often receives is the underwhelming sidecast, especially in comparison to the phenomenally characterized protagonist; while this criticism isn’t necessarily wrong, I feel like it’s missing the point of Kokou no Hito - it’s an autobiographical work through and through, detailing the life journey of Mori Buntarou, so I do not see why a sidecast with more focus is necessary. I agree though that a few characters could have been handled with more care, especially Yumi and Miyamoto. What is often forgotten is that Kokou no Hito did have a few side characters that, while only having a short appearance in the series, were handled in an absolutely brilliant way, perfectly showcasing what the series can achieve in terms of atmosphere and thematic exploration.\n\r\nAnother aspect I want to address is the conclusion - Kokou no Hito has probably the most impressive final act I have witnessed in media; the narrative shifts completely, switching between the last climb and the memories and thoughts of our protagonist, giving it a very unchronological and confusing feel. Indeed, many people need a reread of the last two volumes to fully grasp what's presented, but this makes for one of the most absorbing and cathartic conclusions I have seen, being simultaneously inspirational and cathartic.\n\r\nYes, this series is flawed, but I truly believe that its positives more than overweigh its shortcomings; it’s insightful on a very personal level, detailing the life of a fully fleshed out and explored protagonist, while presenting themes that are relevant to all of us. Kokou no Hito is a journey, for the protagonist and the reader alike, and it’s a journey I would love to embark on time and time again. It fully absorbs you into the mountains, making your crave for fulfillment yourself, and that is the greatest feat a work of art can achieve.\n\r\nRecommendations: \r\n-Oyasumi Punpun for capturing the same emotional beats\r\n-Neon Genesis Evangelion for an anime that is similarly structured in narrative and has a strikingly similar protagonist\r\n-Ping Pong for another psychological/sports series that conveys similar thematics""]"

""\n\r\n* * * *\r\nnow, i know what you are thinking after reading that sypnosis. Another generic mediocre romcom, isn\'t it?\r\nWRONG. Sure, the plot line is nothing new and it\'s just like most other LN\'s. So what sets it apart from other LN?\r\nFirst, this is one of the most realistic LN out there (pretty rare).\r\nAnd Mainly, the difference lies in characters.\r\nHikigaya, is, a loner. It\'s not like he wanted to be one, but he had some mental trauma from junior and middle school and other circumstances forced him to be one. He tries his best to distant himself from others. He\n                  ...\ntries to read between words. Plus, he has dead fish eyes that makes people not to approach him.\r\nThen, he meets yukinoshita, she\'s a loner too but a complete opposite of 8man. Excellence at everything she does.\r\nAnd then yui yuigahama. She\'s total opposite of 8man and yukinon. Popular, good looking and a nice personality who wants to get along with everyone.\r\nThese three make make up the service club.\r\nThe story moves along with the requests the service club gets.\r\nNow most anime watchers say that Oregairu doesnt have a story, but, is that true?\r\nIt does have a story. It\'s a character driven story, and a good one at that. We see how Service club tries to solve the request they get.\r\nAgain, so what? What\'s so good about those requests?\r\nNOTHING. The request are simple. What matters is how 8man solves it.\r\nAnd more than that, we see the psychology aspects of high school students and the philosophy of today\'s society with those requests.\r\nHikki\'s view on other people, the society, is harsh. It\'s crude. (lets just say cynical, k?)\n\r\nYet, none of it is wrong. Instead, his view is so accurate that you cant even refute that. And it\'s thought provoking.\r\nAs i said, this LN is realistic, so even you, the reader, have to agree with his views even if you dont want to.\r\nHikki is called monster of logic. Why? Because he has a logic for everything.\r\nHikki\'s thoughts are contradictory. It\'s full of sofistry. Yet, you agree with him.\r\nYukino & yui, both try to solve the problems. But for some reason, 8man is the only one who solves it.\r\nBut his methods are not complementery.\r\nAnime watchers, who saw those methods, said, "" HIKIGAYA IS BADASS "".\r\nBut no, he\'s not. It\'s just that hikigaya doesnt have other options.\r\nThis series, has an amazing writing style and narration. You relate to the characters, you cheer for them, you feel sad with them.\r\nThe character development is also good, something you should look forward to.\r\nThe story, as I said, is character driven. There are plot twists, there are some sad moments, some cheerful moments, some satisfactory moments.\r\nThe art illustrations are good too. Especially the color illustions. Those are beautiful.\r\nBut hey, is this really a love comedy?\r\nYes and no. It\'s like 25% comedy, 10% romance. But the rest of it, is the reality described in a cruel way, harsh words.\r\nNow, something about yukinoshita. She\'s an ideal student, but even she has her problems. She has a bad tongue, plus she\'s beautiful. Also she\'s a cat lover.\r\nMakes her a good character.\r\nYuigahama, is someone relatable, for me personally. Someone cheery and who wants to get along with everyone. Reminds me of my highschool days.\r\nThe thing is. Every character, including side ones, are people you\'ll find around you. The atmostphere, is exactly like a high school.\r\nIt doesnt feel artificial or fictional, like most LN\'s in market.\n\r\nAbout romance angle, it\'s there. Yui and yukino, both have shown an interest in hikki. (Plus 2 more characters, but that\'d be spoiler)\r\nand finally, a minor spoiler.\r\n"" I want something genuine. ""\r\nwhen hikki says that, he cries. The badass, cries. And at that moment, your heart warms up.\r\nBut what does hikigaya want? What is that genuine thing?\r\nIt\'s something you, the readers have to find out.\r\nOverall score : 9/10 \r\nIf you liked the anime, then you\'re gonna love this LN even more.']"

The mystery of what lies at the bottom, the atmosphere of the unknown, dangerous monsters, cute fluffy animals, rich fantasy flora, rare treasures and unique relics, each detail of this amazing fantasy world was crafted with love and dedication. Let\'s not forget the beautiful art, not only it\'s impressive from technical standpoint, but even less detailed panels are full of life and emotions. The setting is definitely intriguing and raises a lot of questions by the\n                  ...\nreaders, which may be enough for some people to keep following this manga, despite sporadic release shedule.\n\r\nThe problem is that the plot doesn\'t quite deliever on the level of premise and the hype surrounding this series. \r\nWhile the concept leaves a lot of space for an interesting worldbuilding and seems like a perfect set up for an adventure, the story mainly focuses on character drama, which isn\'t a bad thing, when it\'s done right, but that\'s not the case. Simply put, Made in Abyss characters are lackluster and even uncompelling, you have basic tropes like a naive girl with a dream to become as great as her legendary parent, an amnesiac nice guy, who wants to protect his friends and does it by magically remembering how to use his powers in the right time, a strict, but secretly caring mentor figure, possessive yandere and bunch of talking plot-devices, some of them died or leave the series when we barely spent time with them. I couldn\'t even feel anything for them, which was completely jarring. Interactions between characters don\'t seem to have been enough to generate the feelings they show to each other, a good example is a girl from the fifth layer, who developed a deep connection to Riko in a matter of few pages. If you build a drama on a weak foundation such as cardboard cutouts instead of characters and forced, tropey relationships between them, it is bound to collapse. \n\r\nHowever, I wouldn\'t rank Made in Abyss so low if it wasn\'t for blatant emotional manipulation. Instead of building up the characters and making me care about them so that when something bad happens to them I get an emotional reaction, author is simply shoving sad tropes down your mouth without realizing what actually makes those tropes sad in the first place. It just throws in a tragic backstory out of the blue, just to make you feel sad, without having the reader connected to the character beforehand. The characters aren\'t so much characters as they are just sob stories with pretty designs (since lolis are cute and innocent - and will clearly elicit sympathy from readers) and the plot isn\'t so much a plot as it is a mechanism that allows to read these sob stories, before it throws us contrivances to get some weak emotional pay-off. At which point I didn’t understand why I should give a damn about characters suffering. Normally, empathizing with a character requires first understanding that character as a valid human being, an individual with a perspective the reader can relate and believe in, but Made in Abyss bypass that part by making all participants of Suffering Olympics adorable and pure little girls, often fetishized and reduced to moe fanservice. I started to lose faith with an author once I sensed that he is making bad things happen to a character just as a cheap plot formula and WOW SO EDGY HURTING A LOLI MY GOD ARE YOUR HEARTSTRINGS TUGGED YET?! \n\r\nThat\'s being said, after certain point the genre of the story shifts from grand adventure to a loli tear-jerker, abandoning all previously estabilished positives and delving deeper in the territory of meaningless mysery porn. The criticism is not that the manga is too bleak and dark. Lots of manga are bleak and gory. The criticism is that Made in Abyss seems to revel in that bleakness like an exploitation movie. Sure, edgy stories can be fun when athours are self-aware and creative enough to entertain reader with their twisted imagination, but when all you can offer is 50 shades of suffering lolis reading it becomes a complete chore, especially when no one of those bloody and disgusting scenes has any impact on the story. Riko\'s nerve damage and lack of agility in her arm is never used as plot point and Riko herself learned nothing from this failure. Reg lost his arm, but got Dragonball boost and never experienced any troubles while fighting. Faputa lost her arm and ear, but regenerated, two volumes later entire chapter was dedicated to her almost being eaten alive, but she regenerated AGAIN. What makes it worse, 50 shades of loli guro tries to aim to be something more and deeper than is actually is, but the lack of character development is a clear indication that violence and sexual innuendos were written for the sadistic joy of author and some readers. Character progression is basically nonexistant, blink and you miss it all. We are talking about small children here, small children adventuring in the hell pit, where thousands of adults died or lost their minds, children, who went through the loss of limbs, death of their friends and near-death experience, but not a single trait changed in them. By the end of current volume Riko is still a starry-eyed child, who wants to make friends with everyone and totally delusional about her ideals, Reg is no different from any shounen lead and Nanachi is going through the same character arc for the third time. A good author will use a cruelty of the setting to make characters grow from their hardships, but Made in Abyss author uses dark fantasy as an excuse to torture cute kids and show them naked. \n\r\nBetween the rushed pacing of the upper layers, the snail pace of the village arc, disjointed story full of cheap deus ex machinas, shallow characters and their forced drama, the sexualization of kids was just a last straw to the cocktail of disappointment. I\'ve seen some people who are justifying the tittylation of 12 years olds by bringing a good ol\' ""for the plot and development"" argument. Oh, if only Reg\'s or Riko\'s quality of writing was equal to the amount of pages where they are displaying private parts. Dostoevsky himself would be in awe of their depth. Ironically, the manga itself is the best proof that you don\'t need to show off character\'s erection every 5 pages to make them compelling. The less mangaka sexualizes the character, the better they are written, for some reason a fully dressed villain is the only character who left me in a positive impression, unlike all those poor children that are drawn mainly as a kink fuel.\n\r\nThe simplest way to describe Made in Abyss is unrealized potential: the manga. There are definitely some good parts, a lot of great ideas are burried under the layers of poor writing like a rough brilliants in the mud. I still think that it\'s one of the most visually impressive manga out of there, the setting itself is really interesting, and does an amazing job making you wonder what\'s further down and building up a sense of mystery. The antagonist of Idofront arc is also great, he is the closest the characters get to... actually having a character, charismatic personality and plot relevance for more than one arc. An absolute monster, but charismatic one, with his own warped sense of love and care. But as much as I want to love this manga because many of its pieces speak to me, it just doesn’t hold together with the polish it needs. The engaging introduction to this beautiful fantasy world is wasted on a story that makes it difficult to enjoy it. For every great world building element, there is a horny moment which makes you scratch your head. As interesting as the setting is, the disconnect between fascinating dark chasm and the one-dimensional main characters never truly goes away. The greatest tragedy of Made in Abyss is that it tells us the least interesting story possible in this world.']"

Fun fact: the name Main is a reference to the city of Mainz, Germany.\n\r\ntl;dr\r\nThe best things about Ascendance of the Bookworm is worldbuilding and relationship between people. There are lots of people and names in Ascendance of the Bookworm, but each person feels different and memorable (well of course there are some minor that are forgettable). The author takes full advantage of Myne being from another world\n                  ...\nas she brings not only her knowledge of our world but also common sense and values. The fantasy part of the world feels fulfilling as the novel continues to build this new world, explores its culture, and uncovers its history. The story in general feels quite upbeat and peaceful, but the author never fails to remind the readers of the cruelty and selfishness of the people and, many times, the very world itself. \r\nUnfortunately, because of how detailed Ascendance of the Bookworm is, I can\'t seem to enjoy many other fantasy/isekai since I\'m now starting to nitpick small details e.g. unnaturally high literacy level of laypeople (e.g. written store sign), omission of necessity like toilet and tax, random items that are out of place like drinking straw in medieval-era-esque fantasy (yes, I saw one in a fantasy manga, lol).\n\r\nWorld-building\r\nAscendance of the Bookworm builds not only the world, but also the tales of the gods, the myths and relationships between the gods, as well as how those gods and tales are weaved into culture and history itself. One thing that I really like about Ascendance of the Bookworm is that Myne, being a person from another world, is constantly challenged with things she doesn\'t know about the world and how her ""common sense"" and values are not quite a common sense in this fantasy world. The values of people of the world vary greatly depending on their status and occupation. If you think about it, that\'s how it\'s supposed to be, but most isekai/fantasy doesn\'t even touch upon the difference between modern world\'s culture/common sense and this new isekai/fantasy world, let alone people of different classes. The author takes advantage of Myne\'s ""uncommon sense"" to emphasize the difference in the new world.\n\r\nRelationship between people\r\nThis is a rather interesting aspect of the novel. I don\'t think it\'s wrong to say that the entirety of Ascendance of the Bookworm is built to illustrate relationship between people. \r\nFriendship, familial love, parental love, passion, loyalty, trust.\n\r\nThen, in part 2, Myne who becomes a blue miko apprentice, is pushed to an entirely different world and sees the difference in relationship.\r\nFor instance, commoners (and we) celebrate a birth of a child, but for orphans, a birth of a child is something to be loathed. It\'s another mouth to feed, another person to take care of, and the end of grey miko\'s life as a servant (who is now sent back to the orphanage, most likely permanently).\n\r\nPart 3 onward shows yet another different world: the world of nobility. The world introduces yet another new set of relationship like territorial conflict and political marriage. At the same time, the author also shows how the relationship between nobles differs from commoners. For example, since raising a noble costs a lot of money, nobles of lower status often choose, without hesitation, to raise only children who have higher potential, even if that means leaving their other children to die.\n\r\nAnother fun fact: Ascendance of the Bookworm is one of a few fantasy novel I read that people get PTSD (another example is Goblin Slayer). Considering how common fantasy with monster killing (and people too) and stuff like that, you\'d think PTSD is common (about 10-30% of real life veterans have PTSD at some point).']"

One day Ippo is being bullied out in the open and a man jogging by scares off the kids. Ippo asks the man to teach him how to be strong and thus begins Ippo\'s run of determination.\n\r\nThe theme of this manga is ""What is it like to be strong?"" and pure determination and hard\n                  ...\nwork. It has very good character development showing every last spec of emotion that all the characters feel at every moment, as well as epic fights (although I do admit the fights wouldn\'t be like that if they were real) \n\r\nThere is a good bulk of training in this series and it takes up a good chunk of the series but is more then made up for when the fights roll around. And you know what? I don\'t mind all mind that much because that\'s what boxers do. Train, fight, train, fight. Very good insight on what a boxers day to day life is like.\n\r\nThe comedy in this manga is great. Usually in manga when there is filler people dread, but Hajime no Ippo delivers the most hilarious filler I have ever seen in my days.\n\r\nAll in all Hajime no Ippo is a great long running story with a mangaka that has as much stamina as his protagonist when it comes to writing. (And I\'m not sure about all of you but Hajime no Ippo has motivated me to start working out more and become more  active)\n\r\nOverall Rating\r\n10/10']"
47,['Hunter x Hunter'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/26/Hunter_x_Hunter,"['Before beginning this review, I will like to point out that the intention of this review is not to trigger Hunter X Hunter (HxH for short)fans or let them feel like I\'m attacking them or their intelligence since that is basically the trend in most reviews these days. Most reviews are made with the intention to \'trigger\' a reaction out of fans by criticizing a series to the point that you are telling fans that they are basically dumb for liking a particular series.\n\r\nThis review is simply showing you guys another perspective since HxH fans aren\'t used to seeing much criticism when it comes to\n                  ...\nthis series. Now, shall we begin?\n\r\nHxh is a series that I once loved, the anime that is, now after finishing the anime I went into the manga and quickly realise a problem this series has had in the anime, but now, it was more apparent in the manga. The problem is the absurd amount of dialogue and monologue within it that makes it ridiculous, the author of HxH decided that every single character is going to have long monologue and dialogue, but it\'s even worse when the characters are just redshirts.\n\r\nThe latest arc is especially guilty of this, basically, we as the reader are forced to see the point of view of literally every single character in this arc; the guards of the Prince\'s, the Prince\'s, guards of a Prince stalking another Prince, people associated to a Prince, people keeping an eye on another Prince, the Mafia Bosses, Hunters, the guards of the Mafia Bosses, the people from branch families, all of the underlings of the people from branch families as well, and we can go on and on — I wouldn\'t be surprised if we start getting the point of view from the trees, cats, dogs and basically everything else. You get the point. This is not interesting at all and it\'s just a chore to read. Sure you can say that he is amazing for giving redshirts their moments and making them feel important, but, truth be told, redshirts will always be redshirts! You can give them a few dialogues or give them a purpose later on without watering down the series quality by having them talk about stuff, we as the readers, are already aware of. I also saw the Viz translation, and it\'s a bit better, but still, its too dialogue heavy and unnecessary — just pointing that out before someone says it is Mangastream\'s fault, btw this is wall x text the manga.\n\r\nTogashi is like a student that is writing an essay that should be 800 words in length and thinks that writing a 2000 word essay instead will impress the teacher. That is basically how a lot of the fans are behaving as well, I\'ve seen HxH fans praising the series because it has so many dialogues and saying how long it took them to read a single chapter, like it was some type of accomplishment, while other HxH fans are saying they feel dumb because they are not understanding the plot. The truth is, the reason why some people are having difficulty in understanding the plot is because Togashi, as a writer, is failing to express his work to his readers properly, because all he is doing is throwing dialogue and monologue at his fans and telling them that they should figure out his mess, I\'m not sure how the editor even approve these chapters. If this was a monthly manga then that could be an excuse to why some fans are forgetting vital points, but it\'s a weekly series which means it should be easier to follow and remember. Togashi is also lacking in the ""show but not tell"" type of storytelling, he would rather lazily tell the audience every tiny detail, even the irrelevant ones.\n\r\nI\'m sure Togashi has planned out everything in this arc and that he knows what he is doing, but he is not executing it properly if half of his fans feel like it is a chore to read his manga, it just means he is not writing this arc in a creative way. At the end of the day, its the author\'s story, but he is writing his story to his fans, and if his fans are not liking it, something is clearly wrong. Togashi may have a brilliant idea, but if he is not executing it properly then it is all a waste.\n\r\nThis manga overall is a chore to read and it is boring for me personally, the characters for HxH has always been decent for me, I never had a problem with the characters, I don\'t think they are anything special but at the same time, I don\'t think they are bad. I don\'t like the art style because it is drawn in a generic style that I, personally don\'t like, but its even worst when it is not drawn properly by Togashi. In saying that, the art really doesn\'t affect my enjoyment that much, since there isn\'t much art, to begin with.\n\r\nOverall, this manga is a 4/10, and I don\'t feel like Togashi is taking advantage of his imagination. I know he can do way better than this, and perhaps this series will be a bit more bearable to watch when it\'s animated, whenever that is.\n\r\nTo people that are still enjoying this series, more power to you, but at least try to understand why some peoples are not enjoying it, without talking down on them or challenging their intelligence, because I\'ve seen that a lot.\n\r\nAs a university student, reading HxH feels like reading a school textbook, the only purpose is for you to temporarily memorize information just to pass a test. HxH is at the borderline of a school textbook than a fictional book, which basically sums up how I currently feel for this series, and I\'m having a lot of doubt that my opinion will ever change.\n\r\nThanks for reading if you were able to reach this far.']"

49,['Mushishi'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/418/Mushishi,"[""It's surprising to see the lack of reviews for this manga, considering the fact that the anime boasts 56. Now, I've never seen the anime, so I don't know how it compares to the manga. However, I have read a large scope of manga, of many different genres, and I say this honestly: Mushishi is a masterpiece, a one-of-a-kind work of art, and the mangaka, Urushibara Yuki, is one heck of a storyteller. \n\r\nThe plot in Mushishi develops in a rather episodic format, rather like Natsume Yuujinchou or the anime Cowboy Bebop. Each chapter follows Ginko, who is a wandering 'Mushishi', a specialist who deals\n                  ...\nwith 'Mushi', curious lifeforms whose existence may define the meaning of life. Most of the stories deal with Ginko coming across a mushi-related problem during his travels and solving it, however the story avoids becoming sluggish by occasionally breaking the flow with tidbits of Ginko's past. This change in focus offers us something more from this tale and keeps it interesting. \n\r\nDespite what I said there, the mushi-of-the-week stories aren't something to fool around with either. Each are extremely original and varied, some happy and hopeful, some tragic, some bittersweet, and each with something to add to Mushishi's already complex kaleidoscopic world. Indeed, one of Urushibara's strengths is her ability to present clear storylines and sympathetic characters within the limits of each chapter without overreaching herself; Instead, she cleverly uses wide blocks of scenery and close-ups of conversations and monologues to create a slow languid narrative which, by the end, haunts you and lingers in your memory. \n\r\nIn this case, the art works well. With her pen Urushibara brings to life her bizarre mushi and the wild, earthy feel of nature. Except Ginko, everyone wears a kimono, setting the manga in rural Japan, complete with hills, swamps and rice patties. The style is between sketchy and solid, with clear lines and clean backgrounds present for the most of the time, while sketchy styles animate the wilderness of nature. \n\r\nCharacter development is effective in this manga. The protagonist , Ginko, is truly a wonderful character. His calm and reliable persona is one, which I've yet to see in any other manga and it automatically puts you to ease as you follow him on his journey to discover more about mushi. However, although he is the protagonist, he is presented as more of a side character in the stories and it is the 'mains' (the people with the mushi problems) who are given ample focus to develop their personalities. While you may not remember all their names, you learn enough about them so that you want to know what happens to them, or even care about what happens to them. It's a powerful achievement, considering that most of the characters only appear once in the whole manga. \n\r\nGinko, on the other hand, is an enigma with his western clothing and white hair and green eye, and his character is developed only by a couple of chapters revealing his past and through his numerous interactions with others within the manga. While this could be a weakness in other mangas, it is a strength in Mushishi. Ginko's lack of background story allows more focus on the other characters, the mushi, and their problems. He acts unbiasedly, and only does what he thinks will be best for the people who ask him for help. While the manga follows Ginko, the story is all about the mushi and how they affect the world. \n\r\nIn the end, the story is about that: Mushi, life and nature. We see the effects that Mushi have on people and their lives. We see the array of their powers. We see how they coexist with nature. We see how we can mistake them for the supernatural. And we see how they can bring out the best and worst in us. If you are a fan of fairytales, the supernatural, or even slice-of-lifes, give Mushishi a try. I think you'll find it's graceful way of storytelling a beginning to an addiction.""]"
50,['Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/72467/Shoujo_Shuumatsu_Ryokou,"[""“Sleep and wake and eat and move” - Yuu\n\r\nApocalyptic stories in anime come in many forms and serve a variety of purposes. Many times  the setting allows for action scenes and having a hero come into their own, something like Attack on Titan or High School of the Dead. Others take the situation in slightly different ways, more contemplative ways, series like Casshern Sins or Neon Genesis Evangelion as examples. Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou takes an alternative route of using an apocalypse for object lessons on a variety of topics.\n\r\nThe story of Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou isn't so much about an overarching plot as the chapter\n                  ...\nto chapter encounters and experiences of the main leads, Yuu and Chii. The only connecting element of the series is the girls’ constant movement upward and need for supplies. Their stops along the way result in a wide variety of thought-provoking situations from odd encounters found throughout the crumbling city them are in. \n\r\nMany of these situations take a look at modern society and norms from a future that has forgotten the reason for some inventions: the amazing marvel of technology that is the camera, why humans take pictures at all, and what happens when those pictures are either lost or outlive their subjects as a single example. Other stops focus on the nature of living and what one does when the world and time as we know it has ended. These ideas and their underlying themes make up the true appeal of the series and form the major reason for reading it at all. Each chapter works through a new idea, not offering an answer for the questions the series raises but instead gives that reader a chance to consider things they might take for granted or as a normal, and whether that mundanity is really something to appreciate\n\r\nThe art of this manga skillfully plays into the messages and themes of the story, drifting between believably run down and apocalyptic buildings to slightly fantastical or constructions out of science fictions story. The art, whether meant to be literal illustrations of the dilapidated world surrounding the girls or showing how they see their world as a mysterious,vaguely foreboding landscape pairs well with the readers lack of knowledge of the world, being shown only what the main characters see. Every location that Yuu and Chii visit contains broken constructs, hints about the activities and purpose of each area, and creates a wonderful atmosphere of a once mighty and thriving world now breathing its last.\n\r\nEspecially effective are the vaguely ominous and foreboding backgrounds, hinting at world that fell to ruin and only continues down the path of entropy. The final few chapters especially point to how little remains of the human world and how broken it is without upkeep and inhabitants. Watching Chii and Yuu traverse this vast and varied landscape is another major selling point for the series, as it is a masterful example of a story without words, giving information through interpretation and implication rather than outright explanation.\n\r\nShoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is a masterfully crafted trek through a dying world, contemplating the very reason for living and being, seen through the eyes of two girls who make do with whatever they have. While perhaps a slow boil, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou is a unique collection of ideas wrapped in a deceptively simple yet deeply intriguing world.""]"
51,['Chainsaw Man'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/116778/Chainsaw_Man,"['EDIT: Chainsaw Man is really intense, and not for everyone. This manga features child neglect/abuse, gore, vomiting, grooming/psychological manipulation, and pedophilia. If any of that is upsetting for you, tread carefully!\n\r\nThis review was written after the ending of Part 1.\n\r\n--\n\r\nI hate reviews that start off with unnecessary prose, so let\'s skip all that and get to the meat of things!\n\r\nChainsaw Man is a story which thrives in its unexpectedness. It\'s a story that takes you for twists and turns in its plot and characterization, but mostly through its simultaneous homage to and subversion of shonen tropes. It\'s a story that looks dumb as hell, with\n                  ...\na protagonist who acts dumb as hell, with a goal that seems dumb as hell (touch some booooooooobs). But where Chainsaw Man gets you is that it anticipates your exhaustion with these tropes. It anticipates that you\'ll accept the meathead perverted protagonist at face value and shrug off the lack of culpability put on Makima for her actions in endangering a minor. Because all shonen protagonists are teenagers who go through terrible things and are burdened with the fate of the world on their shoulders, so who cares?\n\r\nFujimoto does. And he wants *you* to care, too. And so he deconstructs common, unquestioned tropes left and right, creates characters whose complexity extends beyond convoluted backstories, and constantly ups the ante, all without creating a story so large it self destructs.\n\r\nPART 1: Don\'t Open the Door (Denji, the Plot, and Subverting Shonen Tropes)\n\r\nAt the core of Chainsaw Man is its protagonist, Denji: a destitute, impoverished teen, who struggles daily to survive a cruel and uncaring world in order to pay off his late father\'s insurmountable debts to the yakuza. By his side is Pochita, his pet chainsaw devil. Denji is willing to do most anything to make a pretty penny: cutting down trees, hunting devils (which is highly dangerous), even selling body parts on the black market. Denji\'s life is tragic, but it is not meaningless. Unlike many shonen protagonists, his life of barely surviving on a piece of bread a day with his father\'s impossible debt looming over his head, is not a set piece to get the plot rolling, and quickly be forgotten. Nor does his backstory encompass the entirety of his character and limit his development. Denji\'s difficult past deeply influences his worldview and personality, but he is still treated as a highly impressionable teenager. He is both naive about the ways of the world and intimately familiar with the worst humanity has to offer.\n\r\nWhen Denji joins the Public Safety Devil Hunters, he doesn\'t have much of a higher calling. He frankly doesn\'t care much about killing devils to save people or anything like that (at least, not at the beginning). It\'s a do or die situation: after being attacked by a devil, Pochita, saves his life by giving him his chainsaw devil powers. In exchange, he asks Denji to chase his dreams. When the local Public Safety force which protects Japan from devils arrive on the scene, Denji is given an ultimatum: to die at their hands as a devil, or to sacrifice his freedom to work for them, using his unique powers to become a devil hunter. Denji accepts the latter, of course. But Denji does not hate Makima, the devil hunter who put him in this situation. Instead, he is grateful to her, because she hugged him and promised to feed him breakfast.\n\r\nDenji\'s tragic backstory doesn\'t exist just to make him easier to root for. It is a *core component* of who he is in a way that is incredibly compelling, as well as being more authentic to the real-world impact of severe trauma (especially childhood trauma). His easy acceptance of the dilemma Makima presents him with is rooted in the fact that he has never really been free. He\'s used to being used. At least he knows Public Safety will feed him. Throughout the story, every single one of Denji\'s dreams -- to eat good food, to have a friend to play video games with, to touch a girl\'s boobs, to have sex with a girl -- is a painful reminder of his deprived childhood. Denji is blunt, and Denji is simple. The only things he wants are safety, a home, and a person who cares about him.\n\r\nIn an incredibly refreshing twist, Denji\'s history of abject poverty and his role as a devil hunter is not passed off as \'normal,\' and is instead actively questioned and challenged.  The most overt example of this takes place halfway through the first part, when Denji makes a friend his age who truly sees him for who he is. Together, the two of them sneak into a high school to goof around and hang out. But, partway through the evening, Denji\'s new friend says this: \n\r\n""At 16, you\'re still just a kid, you know? It\'s when most kids are studying to get into college, throwing themselves into a club or a sport, hanging out with friends.... But *you\'re* killing devils, almost getting killed yourself... Is this Public Safety place you\'re with right now really a good place?""\r\n""Yeah, they\'re super great! I get three meals a day and I get to sleep in a bed.""\r\n""That\'s, like, the *bare minimum* standard of living in Japan... It\'s *not* something amazing.""\n\r\nAh! How refreshing!! Another character acknowledging that Denji\'s situation is irrevocably fucked, and *specifically* because of his age!!! Of course, hurt/comfort tropes have their place in shonen. But I\'ve never seen a conversation like this, where a character tells the protagonist that not just one thing that happened is sad or fucked up -- that their whole situation sucks, actually, and why isn\'t anyone doing anything about it? (I love Fullmetal Alchemist dearly. I spent the entire manga and both anime waiting for ONE (1) person to acknowledge that being a child soldier at age 12 is Kinda Bad instead of impressive.) There are no other teenage devil hunters who are thrown into combat because they are ""talented"" or ""smart"" or whatever. It just isn\'t done. Denji is a special case, because he is a devil hybrid, and is explicitly treated as inhuman by most of the cast. In a genre populated by underage protagonists tackling world-destroying threats, it\'s very refreshing to see this questioned.\n\r\nIn the interest of avoiding spoilers, I\'ll refrain from going further into Denji\'s character and development. But just know that Denji is not a static protagonist, and his ridiculous quest in the first dozen or so chapters to touch a girl\'s boobs is not his defining trait. Generally speaking, I hate perverted protagonists! I think they\'re annoying as hell. But Denji isn\'t a pervert. He\'s a traumatized kid looking for connection with someone, anyone. And that, to me, is compelling.\n\r\nPART 2: Connections and Supporting Characters\n\r\nThe supporting cast in Chainsaw Man is great, because they are all batshit crazy.\n\r\nOne character acknowledges that you have to have a few screws loose to survive as a devil hunter. These characters -- many of whom aren\'t human -- act entirely outside the boundaries of normal behavior to survive as devil hunters. And yet they\'re all still realistic and compelling, with their own goals, relationships, personalities, and traits. There\'s a sort of impulsivity about their actions, which only adds to the sense that these are characters who are just trying to survive a chaotic and cruel world. In so doing, Fujimoto enhances the complexity of his characterization, while also lending to the frantic pacing of the plot.\n\r\nChainsaw Man features a *lot* of character death. Will your favorite survive to the end? Chances are, probably not! But despite that, somehow Fujimoto avoids exhausting readers with deaths. You know you shouldn\'t care, because there\'s no guarantee they\'ll live to the next chapter, but you still do. Some deaths are foreshadowed for entire chapters, while others happen entirely out of the blue. But regardless, each serves a purpose, and each is genuinely upsetting.\n\r\nBeyond that, each character develops and progresses naturally, where even your least favorites start to grow on you. (I hated Kobeni when I started reading Chainsaw Man. Now I would die for her.) They don\'t all progress in a positive way, but they are constantly changing.\n\r\nA true standout character in my eyes is Power. She\'s a fiend -- a devil possessing a human corpse -- who is a fellow devil hunter, and becomes one of Denji\'s closest friends. She\'s also a total bastard.\n\r\nPower is very unique in my eyes, because, yes, she\'s really cute and funny, but she\'s also an absolute moron. That\'s not very common in anime and manga, for female characters to just be stupid! Usually, a dumb female character is a cutesy airhead whose obliviousness is played for laughs and/or ecchi scenes. But Power is just as much of a jerk as Denji, if not more. They get up to antics together, prank their housemate Aki, riff off each other, and generally have an incredibly strong dynamic. As a female anime fan, it\'s really, really refreshing to see a female character whose gender doesn\'t limit her personality traits to only \'cutesy\' feminine stuff! It\'s also really refreshing to see a 100% platonic dynamic between her and Denji. (Power is also a very compelling character herself, which I won\'t get into because Spoilers.)\n\r\nChainsaw Man doesn\'t shy away from depicting unhealthy relationships, either. The relationship between Denji and Makima is one of the most crucial and compelling things about the manga, and it is laden with emotional manipulation and abuse tactics. Depicting grooming is difficult enough, and doubly so when the groomer is a beautiful woman. However, Fujimoto manages to capture the duality of such a relationship: both the kindness which draws a victim into an abusive relationship, and the cruelty which keeps them there. Again, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, I\'ll stop here. But I will say that reducing Denji to a simp does a great disservice to both characters, and also perpetuates the toxic idea that men can\'t be victims.\n\r\nI really wish I could ramble about all the characters in Chainsaw Man, because I love literally all of them (except Santa Claus and Makima. All my homies hate Santa Claus and Makima). But much of what makes them amazing can\'t be summed up in brief personality descriptions, and instead has to be read through their relationships with each other. For all the brashness and bluntness of the manga, there is a beautiful subtlety to the character development, which is best experienced, rather than told.\n\r\nPART 3: Art\n\r\nThe art of Chainsaw Man seems to be a point of contention for many! Personally, I\'ve always liked it. I find that Fujimoto\'s sketchy style lends to the feeling of urgency and dread as you\'re waiting for the next Big Thing to happen. Also, his expressions and grasp of anatomy is godlike. But the art *is* very sketchy, and sometimes his characters fall a bit out of proportion (especially on profile views). Where Fujimoto\'s art truly shines is in Chainsaw Man\'s many gory fight scenes and eye-grabbing panels. In general, Fujimoto\'s panel construction is incredible. You can definitely see that he\'s a huge film fan, with how he uses all sorts of different angles and layouts in an attempt to emulate famous cinematography. Chainsaw Man is not a story that happens to be a manga -- it takes advantage of the medium to lay itself out as a storyboard, and lets the reader fill in the gaps. (God, it\'s going to look so good animated. Hype.)\n\r\nAlthough Chainsaw Man loves blood and guts, it\'s not super intense / detailed -- squeamish folks may want to tread carefully, but most people will probably be fine. The gore isn\'t gross, but it is fun and flashy. Character design-wise, Fujimoto really shines with designing the various devils, fiends, and half-devil hybrids, as well as making all the members of Public Safety stand out despite their simple designs.\n\r\nOverall, you can tell that Fujimoto believes in the ten-second principle -- most people spend only ten seconds looking at a panel before moving on. But his artistic chops can\'t be denied, especially when you\'re looking at the full-page or spread panels.\n\r\nPART 4: In Summary\n\r\nTo finish this off, I want to say that Chainsaw Man is good as hell. It\'s a smart manga that is gory, painful, frequently hilarious, and will make you feel despair like you\'ve never felt before. But beyond the blood, guts, gore, and sex, Chainsaw Man is at its core a story about trauma, chasing your dreams, personal growth, and the connections you make with other people (for better or for worse). I wouldn\'t go so far as to call it a deconstruction, but if you\'re a shonen fan who\'s become a bit disillusioned with the genre, Chainsaw Man is a breath of fresh air. (Especially since as of December 14, 2020, when this review is being posted, the announcement for an anime AND a ""part two"" of the manga just dropped a few days ago. And part 2... oh boy howdy does it look good!) \n\r\nWhile the pacing is quite fast, I think it suits the tone of the story quite well; after all, this isn\'t exactly a forgiving world, and the characters themselves are rarely given any downtime. The rapid pacing doesn\'t mean that Fujimoto overlooks his characters for the sake of keeping the plot moving; on the contrary, it allows him to write more subtle, easily overlooked moments of setup and characterization, keeping up the hype while also ensuring that future developments aren\'t cheap or jarring. It adds a lot of reread value, which I find most manga to be lacking in. Once you know how things end, looking back to analyze in depth how things got to that point in the first place is really interesting!\n\r\nI want to be clear: this story *hurts*. It\'s immensely tragic. One chapter was so sad and stressful that another mangaka had to take a week-long mental health break. I was basically comatose for an entire day after binge reading it, and I\'m still unpacking all that I read. But, if you\'ve got the time and energy to devote to it, Chainsaw Man is an incredibly unique experience that won\'t let you down.']"

Most want to just berate me, but some do want more information. For those few people, I will add some more:\n\r\nThe interaction and dialogue between characters seems off. To me, they do not communicate like a normal person. I know they are meant to be odd people, but the writing made it difficult to understand or even become interested in what they had to say. The best way I could describe it is if aliens came to Earth and only studied humans via anime. And then they tried to write a story based around two awkward anime characters, that\'s what this felt like.\n\r\nSome people have pointed out that it is due to bad translation. My first language is Japanese, I read all Japanese literature untranslated.\n\r\nAs stated before, the ""complexity"" is just a mess. The many ""rules"" of the world are not defined, but this seems to be very intentional, but not to provide ""mystery"" or ""twists"". It seems as though the author made it so they can add or modify rules for their needs. The ""twists"" only seek to surprise us without adding any value to the plot. Situations in the novel change, drastically at times, for no apparent reason but only to meet the author\'s objective. This is a classic blunder by bad writers. They have a beginning and an end, but they don\'t know how to write the middle to tie the two.

53,['Shinyaku Toaru Majutsu no Index'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/24875/Shinyaku_Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index,"['Like a whirlpool, the Index franchise focuses on a story that spins and revolves detailing the events of various characters. A labyrinth of secrets, ideologies, and developments constitutes the story made up of two sides – magic and science. But yet, the world sees both sides develop with abnormality and struggles. A single word cannot describe such a struggle as a dangerous group looms in the darkness…just waiting to strike and take over, setting about a new era of desolation. \n\r\nToaru Majutsu no Index: New Testament (also known as A Certain Magic: New Testament) is the sequel of Index light novels series written by Kamachi\n                  ...\nKazuma. As a light novel, expect text and lots of text of not just based on conversations but also technical standards to convey its essence. This is New Testament focuses on how both the magic and science side go about with their plans with the story. Additionally, these plans involve our main characters. Armed with the Imagine Breaker, we meet Touma Kamijou, a normal boy who is thrown into a world of abnormality. As a main male protagonist, he also plays the role of a hero for his efforts in the prequel in the World War III arc. Of course, to say he did that all by himself would be an understatement. Characters such as Misaka Mikoto, Accelerator, and Shiage Hamazura also have their various roles. In this sequel known as Toaru Majutsu no Index: New Testament (NT), their roles extends to ways that will change the world forever.\n\r\nBut the world of NT is not so different from the prequel. For standards, there’s still Academy City where normal humans and espers reside. Then, there are other settings, some that you may be familiar with such as Hawaii, Tokyo, and the United States. Then, there are places that will strike out as peculiar such as the Baggage City, where a major event occurs caused by unrest. Nonetheless, NT exploits these settings to bring out one simple concept – diversity. And on a technical standard, there is also focus, as an emphasis on the story. As mentioend before, there is a dangerous new organization made up of powerful magicians seeking to change the world. In NT, the audience will learn more about their goals and ideologies from all angles.\n\r\nAt its best, NT works like a computer introducing many new characters and ideas that all connects to the story. Among some of these ideas spell out mysteries such as the origins of the Imagine Breaker, the near indestructible Windowless City, and truth regarding espers. And among these mysteries, there is the mysterious organization composed of powerful magicians known as Gremlin. While their goals are controversial, their purpose seems to suggest for the world to get a better understanding of itself. NT explores this organization against the world by characterizing their members and their personas. One particular member, the leader of Gremlin, is unique in many sense with her personality. And in one of the most dynamic volumes of the series, her fight with Touma constitutes beyond just the typical boxing or esper duel-abouts. It formulates a path going beyond the world of normalcy in incalculable ways. \n\r\nOf course, conflicts doesn’t always end without solutions. Thanks to the efforts of the protagonists, problems do get resolved but not without some unlikely allies. Some of these new characters are introduced from various countries and backgrounds with their own ideologies. On the other hand, a few of them feels edgy and their actions can be predictable on some standards. Furthermore, it could be an overstatement to label them as “allies”. NT characterizes its characters by various backgrounds not by just through motivation but also with a multitude of purposes. These have reasoning and connects to the overall story effectively. The niche to some parts of the story sometimes become dissected by generics and unnecessary comedy. Still, it is tolerable and doesn’t get in the way of its ultimatum. \n\r\nSimilar to its previous predecessor, NT also has its darker dynamics. The dark side of the Academy City is explored upon with revisits to both past characters and newer ones. Espers are indeed to be both feared and respected. NT circumnavigate various human emotions relating to espers. Characters such as the level 5 Accelerator seek absolution after his actions in the infamous ‘Sisters Arc”. Then, there are dynamics focusing on people that opposes them. A theme of bigotry plays the role here involving characters that go against espers in arc specific stories. They are crafted by various ideologies that connects well to NT’s world.\n\r\nThere are 9 volumes of NT currently released and most of them are predominately focused on Gremlin’s goals. Yet, there also other volumes that explores the dynamics of supporting characters from different family origins. Eventually, their unorthodox roles connects together with NT’s main story that enlightens the path of a memorable journey. \n\r\nUnfortunately, NT still has its generics surrounding our characters. Most of the main characters does not go any drastic personality change despite some of the events involved. Furthermore, the comedy moments often feels forced, repetitive, and on occasions even asinine. While some of the characters’ dynamics are fascinating, most of the main characters’ backgrounds still remains in unexplored territory. Characters such as Accelerator and Hamazura returns but has less focus on their background development. This is perhaps the result of a large story casting that orientates more on the story. Yet, on many opportunities, there should be occasions to explore their backgrounds but most of it is brushed off. Misaka Mikoto, Academy City’s ‘Railgun’, also suffers development in particular with her relationship with Touma. There’s a weakness in pacing and most of it is lost thanks to Touma’s actions. \n\r\nLuckily, fans may come to appreciate some of the newer characters. While some of them lack originality in terms of character design, their persona may paint a memorable experience for readers. Their behavior reflects a clear and concise way of influencing others. Furthermore, their roles in the arcs in each volume let the readers get to know more. Most of them aren’t disposable either as the more prominent characters introduced in NT are characterized by strengths of their roles. I think fans can appreciate the way Kamichi writes his story to categorize them each differently and in his own way. On the other hand, some of those characteristics may come as cliche or unsatisfying depending on preferences. \n\r\nAs a light novel, there isn’t much artwork to write home about. Yet, the dialogues captures the many creative ways Kamichi describes his characters. It’s easy to picture what’s happening on most occasions with fitting imaginations because his descriptions often use similes and comparisons. I like the concept behind his way of describing the character vividly and to fine details. These include the clothes the characters wear, their powers, and personalities judged by actions. Some dialogues later on in the volumes really reflects emotions and the pains revolving the actions/results of the antagonists.\n\r\nOverall, NT is something of a gift, ready to be opened by fans of Index. The LN is fairly long with each chapter detailing events in fine detail with clever dialogues. And because the series offers a diverse cast of characters, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with them individually. Whether esper or magician, there’s special about each character that gets themselves involved with NT’s story. Even as humans, they hold influence too. The back stab to some of these character might lack a bit of background dynamics. Some characters also can be categorized and be put on the generic hall of fame. But for it’s worth, NT is a series that not only expands the Index realm. It revolutionizes it.']"
54,['Koten-bu Series'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/35513/Koten-bu_Series,"[""Let me preface this review by admitting that Hyouka is by far one of my favorite shows. Therefore, I had very high expectations going into its textual form. To be straightforward, these expectations were met and surpassed with no difficulty. The prose, the details, everything else: they all made it possible to easily re-enter the world of Hyouka. And while many say that the artwork in the show is one of its best aspects, it is truly seen in its original novel series that that is clearly not the case, and bluntly, it isn’t even needed.\n\r\nI will refrain from an elaborate review of the first\n                  ...\nfew volumes since KyoAni produced a spectacular adaptation. But for formal review sake, I would simply like to state that these chapters do a wonderful job introducing our beloved characters, and giving life to our favorite Classics Club. Oreki is reluctant as always and Chitanda is as curious as her anime counterpart. \n\r\nHowever, now the question is how well does the story continue? What have we not seen under the precision and beauty of KyoAni’s production? Well, in short, it’s the same quality of substances that viewers have already experienced in Hyouka(2012). Currently, there are only two additional volumes that are not part of the animation (except for one chapter about Ogi-sensei and helicopters).\n\r\nThe first additional volume, volume 5, is an arc where the Classics Club members are now second years. They attempt to recruit more members and stumble upon an underclassman that seems interested initially. However, her interest suddenly changes and tension is caused between Chitanda and this new character. Oreki utilizes his power of deduction, as he does, to find the reason for her sudden change of heart. These chapters were an interesting read. It gave us a shakeup in the cast as well as an entertaining chance to imagine Oreki in his prime environment, the school marathon. \n\r\nHowever, what I truly enjoyed was volume 6. Although there is still a slim chance, I still feel disappointed that I probably won’t be able to experience these chapters in an animation form. For a concise summary, these chapters dive deeper into the club members' individual and unique character (all except for Satoshi - but he already had that Valentine chapter so no harm no foul). It shines the spotlight on Ibara and her manga, Oreki and his motto, and Chitanda and her future. While these chapters are episodic, as viewers of Hyouka can expect, it is written superbly and emotionally intriguing, and is obviously a sign of love for the characters. Each chapter fleshes out an individual, allowing for even more relatability from the reader, and provides additional evidence supporting the growth of their relationship with another character. \n\r\nThroughout the series, we get to see Oreki use his logic in these so-called mysteries that many could argue to be futile or obvious. But what I learned from Hyouka and continue to agree with after reading these two volumes, is simply that the beauty of this series is not in the detective work. The true gem is found within our four curious characters (some more curious than others), their bonds, and their ever so subtle development as they fabricate, experience, and enjoy their rose-colored high school life. \n\r\nHow can I guarantee this series is as good as I say it is? Perhaps I’m being biased. Perhaps the translators deserve the credit by providing improvements, obvious or subtle, to the story (I will never know if this is the case). Perhaps it is naive for me to say that there isn’t anything else like this series in the world (partly because one could say this for any piece of art that hasn’t been struck with copyright infringements, partly because my experience in (light)novels is meager compared to those who can proudly say they are experts in this medium). \n\r\nPerhaps. \n\r\nBut perhaps Yonezawa created a series that is actually as magnificent as I believe it to be... yeah, I prefer that one. And if it is true, it gives merit to my review. But alas, since this is a subjective review, as all reviews happen to be, I believe that my opinion on Oreki’s quasi-idyllic life could be valid and/or useful to other readers who might have stumbled upon this wonderful series, regardless which “Perhaps...” is true.\n\r\nAlthough what I’m about to say is unfortunately derived from my pessimistic expectations of Yonezawa, I genuinely hope for the continuation of this wonderful series. Maybe this series was just something for fun. Maybe this series was just a lucky break. But as Irisu-senpai said, “Everyone ought to recognize their own talents… Or it would be painful to watch for those without”. \n\r\nBut maybe the author actually got bored of the series, or blinded and overwhelmed by the very rose-colored life he himself manifested. Or maybe he is lost and is unable to discover a clear path for this series to travel upon. If that’s the case, then I, who is simply an earnest fan, give you these wings, Yonezawa, as the path might be hidden in the sky. But if you respond as the innocent Chitanda did when contemplating inside the storehouse, and say, “Even though I’m told I now have wings, what am I supposed to do?”, then I will follow Oreki's footsteps and leave you with something similar to his (lack of) response:\n\r\nI had said everything I needed to say and done everything I needed to do. The rest, no matter how much it pains me, is for you to sort out.""]"
55,['Beck'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/145/Beck,"[""I began reading this manga after marathoning the anime adaptation over two days and finding myself left wanting more, as the anime ended all too quickly for my liking.\n\r\nStory:\r\nBeck follows the life of 14 year old Tanaka Yukio (Koyuki to his friends) as he grows from a shy, directionless teenager (with terrible taste in music) into an ambitious young musician.  After a chance meeting with talented guitarist Minami Ryusuke, his life starts to change and gather momentum as he discovers music's ability to affect people. He begins to learn the guitar, and there is the budding romance with Ryusuke's sister, Maho.  He joins\n                  ...\nRyusuke's band, Beck, and the series follows the band's struggle to achieve success, both in Japan and the rest of the world.  Because this is predominantly a slice of life style manga, many of the minutiae of Koyuki's and Beck's day to day life are covered, but the manga spans 5-6 years, which allows the various characters and their relationships to properly develop.  The one aspect of the story I felt should have been developed a bit more was Maho and Yukio's relationship, it was very well done when it came up, but I think it should have been given a bit more development over the course of the manga.\n\r\nArt:\r\nSakuishi Harold has a fairly distinctive art style in Beck, which I found a refreshing change from much of the overly disproportioned characters found in many manga and anime.  I thought his more realistic style perfectly suited the realistic tone of the manga. His full page frames of the band's performances perfectly captured the spirit of a 'live', and were a personal highlight in the artwork of this manga.\n\r\nCharacter:\r\nIn a manga of this length (both in chapters and period of time covered) there is real space to develop and flesh out both the main and some of the supporting characters.  Koyuki's character develops beautifully over the course of the series, from an apathetic teenager into a determined young man. The other characters don't develop in the same fashion, Ryusuke's background is fleshed out and provides much of the conflict in the series, and while more time could have been spent developing the rest of the band members, especially Saku and Taira, they all have their moments during the series which give them real depth.\n\r\nEnjoyment:\r\nAs I said at the start, I read this manga after finishing the anime adaptation and found myself wanting more.  This was the first time I have watched an anime and then gone on to read the manga, as well as one of the first manga I have read, and I was unsure if I would be able to enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed watching it.  Turns out there was nothing to worry about, and I even rate the manga higher than the anime, predominantly because I feel the story reaches a much more satisfying conclusion.\n\r\nOverall:\r\nTo anyone who loved the anime, I thouroughly recommend reading the manga, as it has everything the anime had, as well as a complete storyline.  I would also recommend this to anyone who is a fan of rock, or music in general, as it is the only series I have come across that deals with music in such an in depth and genuine way.\n\r\nBest read with the OST playing in the background, just like this review.""]"

Seriously, I hated the second half of the story. However, the first half was so ridiculously good, that I just couldn\'t give the manga a bad score.\n\r\nWith that being said, on to the details.\n\r\nStory\r\nBrilliant. I can\'t think of anything else that has even come close to something like this. Entertaining, smart, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Read the second half, if only just to say you have.\n\r\nOverall\r\nDo yourself a favor and stop after chapter 57-59.

There are are a total of nine novels but only the first two have been translated and licensed by Del Rey with no plans for future release.\n\r\nThe story is a murder mystery that takes place on a isolated island.

Personally, I thought the story was the the weakest element, but it entirely makes up for it with the main character ""Ii-chan.""  \n\r\nThe story is told from his perspective. His thought and actions strongly resemble the main character in the novel The Stranger by Albert Camus or possibly the main character from Onani Master Kurosawa except less malicious.  The main character is very indifferent of the world around him.  He is the kind of person that makes you think ""What the hell is wrong with him.""   \n\r\nPeople must have caught on that the series is great because I bought the first book back in 2010 when the second novel came out for about $5 new.

59,['Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/4/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kikou,"['Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou (abbreviated to YKK outside Japan) is an example of the proverbial “diamond in the coal mine”. Written and drawn by Ashinano Hitoshi, the manga was serialized in Kodansha\'s [b]Afternoon[/b] magazine for almost 12 years, and has gathered a number of devoted fans around the world despite the lack of licensed English translations. This comes as no surprise since it is one of the few series which deserves to be treated as a works of literature rather than of pop culture. YKK is a testament to the true potential of manga and the series is recognized as such, having been deemed worthy of\n                  ...\nAfternoon magazine\'s Four Seasons Award for debut works as well as the 2007 Seiun Award for Best Science Fiction Manga.\n\r\n[b]Story (9.7) & Characters (10)[/b]\n\r\nYKK is a science fiction story as it is set in a future after an unspecified large-scale disaster and the main character, Alpha Hatsuseno, is a robot who looks human. However, this is where any similarity to ""regular"" sci-fi ends. There are no spaceships, lasers, or mecha of any sort. Instead, older technology such as scooters, radios, propeller-driven aircrafts and the like, are very much still in use. This is reflective of the rural lifestyle that humanity has adopted in the story and adds to the easygoing pace of the manga. This tranquil, almost bittersweet feeling is reflected in the art style, the characters, and even the manner in which the story is delivered.\n\r\nThe story is told mainly from the perspective of Alpha Hatsuseno as she meets old friends, makes new ones, and casually explores the world around her. The most unusual fact about Alpha is that she isn\'t human, but a type A7M2 robot who looks human and is capable of feeling emotions. The story begins with Alpha taking a trip to Yokohama to buy coffee beans. She has been alone for some time as she waits for her ""owner"" to return from wherever he has disappeared to and, being immortal, she has decided that she can wait as long as it takes. In the meantime, she runs Café Alpha, a small coffee shop in the middle of nowhere which her owner left in her care.\n\r\nBesides Alpha, several other characters also appear throughout the series. Some are shown regularly like Oji-san and his grandson Takahiro who run the gas station near the café. Others turn up less frequently such as the anonymous café customer and the mysterious Misago, an ageless wild woman who only appears before children. Next to Alpha, the other most prominently featured character is Kokone Takatsu, a type A7M3 robot. Kokone is effectively Alpha’s younger sister (production-wise that is), and as their friendship grows, she begins to develop romantic feelings for Alpha which later stir her curiosity about the history and nature of the A7 series.\n\r\nAlthough the other characters do not enjoy as much exposure as Alpha does, several are given sufficient development to be memorable in their own right and their experiences serve as important reference points that highlight the passage of time. Through them, the reader is shown the great expanse of the story spanning the landscape and the era.\n\r\nOne of the most notable achievements of YKK is the manner in which the characters enhance each other throughout the series, and how Alpha gains a new perspective on life through her encounters with them. The interactions between the characters are often laconic and unhurried. Because of this, each encounter gains a languid, almost dreamlike quality that is far more memorable than what can be found in many other slice of life manga.\n\r\n[b]Art (9.7)[/b]\n\r\nThe art in YKK contributes greatly to the relaxed atmosphere of the manga. Ashinano’s style is evocative of the simple yet fantastic nature of the world. In several parts of the manga, commonplace scenes are given an ethereal quality. This, together with the character designs and Ashinano’s unusual use of blank space, gives the art style a surreal characteristic that at times appears almost paradoxical. As with any long running series, the art style has evolved and improved over time.\n\r\nAshinano Hitoshi\'s character designs are perplexingly both spare and meticulous. Each character’s face is basic yet highly expressive; a stark contrast to their elegantly elaborate clothing and accoutrements. This unusual style is further enhanced by the picturesque backdrops and settings which the characters find themselves in. In addition to this, Ashinano has made wonderful use of blank space to emphasize the amount of detail in the characters and settings, something which is more prominently highlighted in the beautiful colored illustrations and panels that appear in the manga. This style of artwork focuses not only on the locations, but on the characters themselves and serves to enhance the reader\'s empathy towards each character.\n\r\nFrom the most beautiful parts of nature to fantastic creations of Ashinano’s imagination (giant sunflowers, underwater streetlights, water gods, kamas, and many other wonders that Alpha discovers), each object and location in YKK helps to transport the reader more deeply into Alpha’s world. Not only is it easy to understand what she is feeling about her surroundings from the art alone, but the simple beauty serves as a way of deeply understanding not only the intricacies of her world, but of ours as well.\n\r\n[b]Enjoyment (10)[/b]\n\r\nMany readers have hailed YKK as the epitome of the slice of life genre and, given the premise, this may be no exaggeration. The series makes exceptional use of “mono no aware” (a Japanese term used to express the awareness of the transient nature of things, and the bittersweet sadness at their passing), and the time period in which the story is set makes the use of this especially poignant. In Alpha\'s words ""It looks like the twilight of this age has quietly arrived. I think I\'ll be around \'til these twilight years end.""\n\r\nReading YKK is without doubt one of the most unique and wonderful experiences in manga. Each chapter is filled with a calm, inviting feeling that pulls the reader into the story like a lucid dream. Alpha is without doubt one of the most engaging characters ever created, combining childlike innocence with reflective maturity. The story is remarkable in both its simplicity and its complexity as the reader is taken on a journey of discovery about themselves, the world around them, and the transient nature of things, whilst the art perfectly resonates with both of these elements to produce an atmosphere like no other.\n\r\nMelancholy yet hopeful, exciting yet wistful, joyful yet sad, YKK is a singular achievement in manga that is deserving of the title ""Masterpiece"", and should be afforded a place amongst the great works of modern literature.\n\n\n\r\n[b]OVERALL - 10[/b]\n\n\n\r\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the [b]""Critics and Connoisseurs""[/b] club.

Characters who are the combination of futuristic cyberpunk and magical fantasy adventure. Artwork by the assistant of BLAME, relying on nothing but new ideas that are weirder than the last one. Story centering around the daily lives of our wide and colorful cast, yet the whole thing is essentially an action comedy. No one could have ever asked for Dorohedoro because it\'s simply too original and specific to be an answer to a need.\n\n\r\nThere are several reasons to like this series,\n\r\n-Significant amount of the original ideas offer new perspective on things. For example,\n                  ...\nstuff like ""curse"" or ""disease"" is not necessary a similar concept as we understand them IRL, but they can vary from living persons to inanimate objects. It plays with words and wits.\r\n-The series stays loyal to its own world and uniqueness to the bitter end. It abandons so many norms and ""in the box"" ideas, introducing its own take on practically every concept it deals with.\r\n-Our cast is memorable to say the least. From their personalities and character design to badassery and taste in food, heavy amount of detail exist in characteristics an character-centric narrative. Liking the characters can end up carrying the entire series during its worst parts because it is just that strong.\r\n-The art work manages to capture the atmosphere of the world in an impressive manner, making Dorohedoro immersive and pretty to look at. Mostly weird, but also pretty.\r\n-The combination of different genres creates a narrative that can offer enormous appeal to those readers who are tired of seeing the same old stuff. \n\n\r\nThe are also several reasons to dislike it,\n\r\n-Some of the weirdness seems to exist just for the sake of it.\r\n-It masks most of the common things and cliche events seem unique by simply using its extraordinary settings and cast, but it never quite seems to live to its full potential. For example, there is always a convenient magic power that can solve the current problem and lead the story to preferred direction.\r\n-Significant amount of the dialogue and text boxes contain something that could be considered irrelevant filler-text. This makes the reading experience suffer in smoothness and in generally, some of the most boring parts are skip-worthy.\r\n-""All of this and more in the most chaotic limbo that is Dorohedoro."" The manga is repetitive and it knows it, but doesn\'t really do anything to counter its repetitiveness. Quality differences exist and are obvious.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment,\n\r\nThe first 50 chapters were a pleasure to me. I could say the same about events around 70 chapter mark and 100 chapter mark. The remaining parts made me change my mind more than once. Dorohedoro was supposed to end first time already over 5 years ago, but it was extended over the next years. Some of it feels forced and rises the question was this length truly necessary for the work? Spoiler: It wasn\'t. It could have been both: more entertaining to read and more meaningful by simply being shorter. This series is worth of reading for everyone who considers themselves a fan of manga, but I really wouldn\'t call it an obligatory read.']"
61,['Akira'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/664/Akira,"['I almost feel bad that, upon re-assessment, I found the classic ""Akira"" to be so flawed. The source material for the first anime I ever saw, I remembered pouring through these volumes the first time Dark Horse re-released them in their giant phone books. While my maturation of taste has definitely not rendered ""Akira"" unreadable by any means, I can\'t help but feel that there is just so much potential for this to be something that it ultimately failed to be.\n\r\nLet\'s get started with the good:\n\r\nThe art for this entire series is impeccable. The character designs are spot-on, but what most impresses me are the\n                  ...\nbackground renderings. Painstaking detail is put into every last crack, stain, dent, shattered window, decimated tenement, obliterated office tower, speck of rubble of this world which starts as a mere dystopia before turning full on post-apocalyptic. I cannot imagine this scale of desolation or destruction rendered in live action. The framing of every shot is well-done and concise, and the action is always understandable and fluid. From a visual perspective, this is still a landmark of manga.\n\r\nNow the not-so-good:\n\r\nThe story is a sci-fi story, extremely graphic in content, which also touches on common adolescent fiction or adult themes. At times, it\'s not too unlike a Japanese sci-fi S.E. Hinton. It straddles cyber-punk by virtue of its cast of drug-addled biker malcontents, but where it fails that level of ""hard"" sci-fi is also a major downfall of the narrative. Make no mistake, it\'s definitely about psychic powers. But the way these powers are explained and how they manifest honestly just seems more like ""magic."" Otomo was clearly not a science buff. ""Energy"" is supposed to explain away a lot of things, like why a human with psychic powers can fly into space and start carving up the moon. \n\r\nThe extent of Akira and Tetsuo\'s powers is absurd and never explained well at all. This would be fine if there was some metaphysical subtext that made this seem like a surreal exposition or magical realism, but there isn\'t. It becomes page after page after page of psychic blasts and things falling around people and that\'s all it feels like. Re-reading the books, I gave up about halfway through 5. I\'d just had enough. It stops telling any sort of meaningful story and almost becomes a Shonen. The point of the story stops being about government intrigue or youth rebellion and shifts to ""Tetsuo is really powerful, look at this powerful display of power, man, the good guys better get him.""\n\r\nFurther, while the character designs themselves were good, their story arcs and character development left a lot to be desired. \n\r\nLet\'s start with main character Kaneda. He is a bad ass biker boy who tries to feel your tits and steals your gun and doesn\'t get killed because he\'s a bad ass, end of story, and oh yeah, he can\'t stop finding reasons why ""this time Tetsuo\'s gone too far,"" hilariously even well after Tetsuo has obliterated the entire city.\n\r\nKei, his sidepiece; She\'s a nonentity. Like, literally, at one point. She lacks so much characterization that the little psychic kids possess her body in a last ditch effort to do battle with Tetsuo. Unlike Kaneda, she is presumably intelligent and cunning enough to be a pivotal member of some underground terrorist cell (whose aims are never really explained, by the way). Despite this, she ends up helpless and useless in just about every key moment of the story. Brash biker badass powers mean more than all the womanly cunning you can muster in Neo Tokyo.\n\r\nTetsuo: Your basic school shooter type. He\'s actually the only character anyone would bother remembering from this book, because there are moments early on when his instability and anger are actually kinda scary. His psychic powers are grotesque and so follows his own mind. In the real origin story of Kaori, who in the film is a meaningless plot device, she is the lone survivor of a drug orgy he conducts, a scene that is honestly really chilling. At the same time, you find him somewhat sympathetic, so obviously unable to control his power. Once again, the Shonenesque final chapters of the saga squander this on psychic blasts and whatnot.\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are the typical ensemble of people who exist to help these main characters get through the story. They have flashes of being interesting; Ryu and the Biker Clown alone have more dynamic story lines, downfalls and revelations than any of the aforementioned. But the story isn\'t about them. The story is using them for things. Not much more.\n\r\nSo I just trashed the all-immortal ""Akira."" Why a rating of 7? Because of the ambition, no matter how misguided, and the detail of the artwork. With proper writing (which is actually hinted at early on in the series, like say, the first couple books), ""Akira"" could have had a story up to par with its amazing visuals. As it stands, it\'s just a kinetic jumble of great imagery that doesn\'t withstand much scrutiny as a whole.']"
62,['Kozure Ookami'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/904/Kozure_Ookami,"['There are many anime and manga that can rightly be considered classics for one reason or another. Of these, only a few can surpass this status and truly be considered masterpieces in the purest form (and when I say a few, I mean exactly that). Supreme amongst these titles is a manga that is considered the single most influential piece of literature (and I do not use that word lightly), to come from Japan during the 20th Century.\n\r\nThat manga is Lone Wolf and Cub.\n\r\nThe creation of writer Koike Kazuo and artist Kojima Goseki, the story tells of Ogami Itto, the Kogi Kaishakunin (Shogun\'s Executioner), during\n                  ...\nthe time of the Tokugawa Shogunate. He returns home shortly after the birth of his son, Daigoro, to find his wife and retainers brutally murdered, and himself suddenly named as a traitor who is expected to commit seppuku. Instead, he gives his 1 year old son, the only survivor of the attack, the choice between a ball and a sword. Should his son choose the ball, then he will be sent to his mother\'s side. Should he choose the sword however, then he will join his father on the road of blood and vengeance, of slaughter and heartless cruelty. \n\r\nThus begins the legend of Lone Wolf and Cub.\n\r\nTo say that the story is breathtaking would be an understatement. There are very few words that can truly convey the depth of the individual tales, or the depth of one\'s emotions as you join Ogami and Daigoro on the road to meifumado (the buddhist hell). This is a work that will evoke almost every emotion you\'d care to name, from righteous fury to heartwrenching sorrow, from earnest hope to blind hatred. The complexity and detail of the plot reveal a level of sophistication that many have tried to copy over the decades since its release, but none have managed to better. The episodic format of the series allows the reader a greater degree of accesibility to the story, whilst losing nothing in terms of character development. If anything, the format actually enhances the various roles, with a number of characters being far more ""real"" in just one appearance than many lead characters in other stories.\n\r\nThe artwork of Kojima Goseki is nothing short of exquisite. The style adopted throughout the series has a certain gritty realism to it, whilst retaining an expressionist form reminiscent of traditional Japanese art. Kojima\'s simple, yet evocative, style allows for a greater degree of expression than can normally be found in manga, with the characters themselves retaining a feeling a reality. The quality of the artwork, together with Koike\'s gripping storyline, allows for a suspension of disbelief that is difficult to match by any other series.\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful in their uniqueness, style and personality. Ogami is a truly complex and many layered character. An assasin with a strong sense of nobility, a ""demon"" who is a loving father and husband, a symbol of hope for some, terror incarnate to many. Daigoro, on the other hand, is how one would expect a child to be, innocent, playful, and with very few cares in the world. One of the most wonderful things about the series is the how it addresses the bond between father and son, and in many stories Ogami bets his life on the strength of this bond. In a very real sense, he is trusting his 3 year old child to ""watch his back"", and this leads to some truly astounding development between the two, especially at the end of the series, with it\'s truly awe-inspiring climax.\n\r\nThere are many other characters who appear throughout the series, however the majority will only appear in one story or another. However, this does not impact on their level of realism, as many of the characters with only one appearance possess an enormous amount of depth from the start.\n\r\nIn the case of Lone Wolf and Cub, enjoyment is purely a specualtive term. The level of realism in the series is breathtaking, and the various action sequences will often leave you speechless, with the most exhilerating being the 178 panel sequence (you\'ll know it when you read it) - possibly the longest fight ever portrayed in manga. The scope of the series is of epic proportions, with each panel searing white-hot across one\'s mind, and unlike many other long running series, this never gets old or stale. I first read this back in 1989, and 20 years later I still get chills whenever I pick it up again. This is a series that you will find yourself re-reading for years to come.\n\r\nThis masterwork of the storyteller\'s art has had incredible and lasting influence both inside and outside of Japan. As well as spawning 7 movies and various TV movies, the series has also been adapted into two TV series and four plays. In terms manga and anime, one need look no further than Rurouni Kenshin, Hokuto no Ken, Black Jack, Vampire Hunter D, Mushishi, etc. In addition to this, the influence on Western media has been just as great. Comics and novels such as Sin City, Cable, The Road, Ronin, Road to Perdition and Waylander all pay homage to the series, with additional references being found everywhere from Final Fantasy and Samurai Jack, to Usagi Yojimbo and Kill Bill. \n\r\nLone Wolf and Cub is a work that has truly crossed the boundary between popular media and true literature. The style, pace, artwork and characterization throughout the series are the benchmarks by which many mangaka set their standards. The global popularity and influence of the series crosses the boundaries of age and gender, with many fans of the series being uninterested in other manga and anime. \n\r\nLone Wolf and Cub is, by any measure, a true masterpiece. Even now, as I close off this review, I still feel I haven\'t done it justice. \n\r\nYes, it IS that good.']"
63,['Natsume Yuujinchou'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/1859/Natsume_Yuujinchou,"['Pleasantly spurred on by the recent reviews and attention this beautiful work has received, I thought I perhaps could toss my hat into the ring and speak a little about Natsume Yuujinchou. Stunning in it\'s simplicity, meaningful in it\'s message, this is a manga that I believe always could use a little more love. \n\n\r\nAt it\'s heart, Natsume Yuujinchou presents a rather simple story depicting the day to day life of Takashi Natsume, orphan and loner from a very young age. In almost every way, Natsume is a normal fifteen year old child, shy and somewhat cut off from the people around him. The one\n                  ...\nthing that sets Natsume apart (and the thing that caused him much stress in his earlier years), is his inheritance from his grandmother Reiko. An inheritance of a beautiful face, a strange book, and the ability to see and communicate with youkai. It is this ability that has led to him being deemed strange and odd by most people, shunned for the weird tales he tells. \n\n\r\nBut as he grows and meets more people he wants to protect, Natsume must work to discover a way to balance the world of humans in which he belongs, and the world of youkai in which he is a part of regardless of his desires. Both of these worlds and the denizens that fill them come to hold meaning to Natsume, and many of the important lessons in the story are derived from him protecting them... often from each other.\n\r\nThe second, and probably most important, aspect of the story is the titular Book of Friends given to Natsume by his powerfully gifted grandmother. In this book are the names of numerous youkai bound to contract by Reiko\'s power to be summoned at any time. Natsume has no need for youkai armies and gladly returns names (and independence) to those who ask. Of course, some prefer to take rather then ask, putting Natsume in a great deal of danger. Luckily, he stumbles across some help in the form of Madara. \n\r\nMadara is a youkai hidden in the form of a lucky cat, and visible to humans only in this form. He agrees to protect Natsume from the other youkai claiming he is only doing so, so he can obtain the book once Natsume dies. What starts out as merely a job blossoms into a humorous caring relationship between the two. Madara bickers, he snarks, he provides much of the comedic relief, but at his core he desires to protect Natsume and he does so without hesitation.\n\r\nTogether with Madara, Natsume struggles through issues we all can relate to. Finding his place in the world, protecting all those dear to him, no matter what they look like or where they come from. He works tirelessly in his quest to understand that which is different and frightening. His is the journey of life, and while his circumstances are different, the core values of respect, understanding, kindness, and love are ones we can all apply to our daily lives. \n\n\r\nThe main twosome of Natsume and Madara make up a fair chunk of the character interaction, but numerous humans and youkai add to the supporting cast. Exorcists such as Natori and Matoba with their rationality and coldness towards youkai, provide as excellent foils towards Natsume\'s idealistic optimism that the two worlds can coexist, and then there of course is his mysterious yet incredibly strong grandmother Reiko, shown in her youkai wrangling youth through flashback. Youkai such as Hiiragi and Chobi-Hige provide a nice insight to kinder more rational youkai, showing that though they are different from humans they are not all monsters. They all add splendidly to the story with their own viewpoints and tales to be told. \n\n\r\nThe art of Natsume Yuujinchou is pleasing yet simple. Human characters are drawn quite realistically, devoid of huge eyes and anime hair. The youkai, as is true in every good supernatural story with spirits and demons, are completely unique in their designs. From a tiny spider youkai to the great beast dragon Madara they are all quite a treat to look at. Madara in his lucky cat form is the most cartoonish aspect of the art, and he\'s quite adorable and very funny. Backgrounds are drawn simply yet effectively. The usual forest scenery is done in nice yet sparing detail. \n\n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou as a manga has fallen prey to what I\'ve recently dubbed ""The Aria Effect"" in which an anime adaptation is done so splendidly that the equally wonderful manga tends to be overlooked. This isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, as lord knows we could use more quality adaptations such as those of the Aria series, and Natsume Yuujinchou. But there is something to be said about the source material and the even more soothing feeling it brings to your heart. \n\r\nNatsume Yuujinchou is a spectacular manga that shouldn\'t be missed whether you\'ve seen the anime or not.']"
64,['Solo Leveling'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/121496/Solo_Leveling,"['The manhwa community entitles Solo Leveling along the lines of ""Not like the other manhwas"" or ""Not your typical power fantasy."" And although I respect their awareness of the prevalent mediocrity in the medium, the aforementioned descriptions are still false. Solo Leveling is your typical power fantasy. And let\'s be honest, ""not like the other manhwa"" is not that much of a compliment.\n\r\nIt\'s mediocre, worse even, to be brutally frank. The narrative is brimming with formulas, has one of the worst character writing I\'ve ever witnessed, and is overall a boring read. The protagonist\'s tale suffers no risk and receives all the rewards. No suspense\n                  ...\nis there to keep the reader on the edge of their seats or in any way to make it engaging. However, Solo Leveling\'s popularity proves otherwise, and it\'s understandable.\n\r\nThe author knows how to attract a specific audience; gamers. The manhwa is the closest thing I\'ve seen to a game developer playing the video game he made, where he knows every exploit there is.\n\r\nSolo Leveling is a superficial narrative. And that simplicity, that lack of depth to its characters, setting, and premise, helps the story in a way that would easily be understandable and doesn\'t create any frequent inconsistencies. However, it still has significant flaws erected from the beginning that was never fixed and became prominent over time. \n\r\nSolo Leveling is very repetitive, and that coincides with its predictability. The beginning does a decent job of depicting the development of Jin-woo\'s power. His power grew steadily, and there was still tension in his fights due to Jin-woo\'s struggle. However, after Jin-woo fully comprehends his abilities and exploits the system, every battle he enters is an automatic win. The initial struggle for power made for great pacing; however, anything after the Igris fight was too easy for him. Every battle was always one-sided in favor of Jin-woo. No single match is present where you\'d think he would lose. It would be more engaging if there\'s a difference between how he wins every time using his wit but he uses nothing but pure power. There is no risk and no suspense. The lack of tension and suspense undermines the narrative\'s engagement, ruining the average reader\'s experience.\n\r\nAnother flaw that you\'ll notice the further you read the manhwa is the characters, more specifically, the irrelevance of every character apart from Jin-woo. Not that Jin-woo is a well-written character in the first place. Every supporting character is just there to be in awe of Jin-woo\'s power, and every villain is there so Jin-woo can flex his power. Spoilers: This is prominent at the final battle, where everyone is useless, and only Jin-woo and his shadows are the only ones with the chance to fight. Everyone else is a liability, and even the most powerful hunter next to Jin-woo becomes a damsel in distress.\n\r\nEven from an interpersonal relationship basis, none of the characters served a purpose, whether it was codependency or for his character development. Interaction with his family and friends that intended to create suspense never works. The slight tension and suspense it tries to portray is immediately undermined, knowing the plot is always in favor of Jin-woo.\n\r\nThe sad irony of these poor character development attempts only worsened Jin-woo\'s character. Before re-awakening, Jin-woo exhibited the most depth out of the other story parts. As his power increases, he becomes more blank, often confused with developing apathy - it isn\'t apathy. Jin-woo loses depth further into the story, making him more of a self-insert character than he already was.\n\r\nI acknowledge the author\'s ability to attract the audience more than other trite cash grabs. They promised a power fantasy, and a power fantasy they gave. It doesn\'t pretend to be anything it is not and continues to satisfy the audience they meant to attract. And the artist\'s talent strongly contributed to the manhwa\'s success. Solo Leveling\'s most vital asset is its art. Each panel\'s vivid drawings and coloring coincide well with its portrayal of power. Things that don\'t make sense are present, like many anatomy issues and shadows emitting light, but that\'s not an issue since, like the story\'s typical writing, it\'s only there to look cool. The artist knows how to draw fight scenes and anything in general - making full use of techniques such as perspectives to their maximum effect.\n\r\nSolo Leveling is just like any other manhwa out there, only that it grew more popular than others due to how it carried its mediocrity. There\'s nothing special or unique about Solo Leveling, but it knows precisely what it\'s doing. If you like power fantasy, you\'ll most likely enjoy this manhwa. If you hate these overused formulas, you\'d be wasting your time if you tried to read this.']"
65,['Bungou Stray Dogs: Beast'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/123006/Bungou_Stray_Dogs__Beast,"['I always have some kind of dissatisfaction when it comes to \'Bungou Stray Dogs\'. Despite liking the different eye designs, the abilities based on real life authors and if we\'re talking about the Anime, the cool OSTs (I still listen to Eye of the Tiger & Inou no Susume) , I always had one problem.\r\nDazai is *too* interesting.\r\nThis might be one of the few cases where I found a character being \'too\' interesting as a problem. Look, Dazai is cool and pretty much the boss & mastermind of the whole story, so bringing him at every point, in every character\'s episode, made him more of\n                  ...\na main character, which weakened the main character-ness of Atsushi. Every port mafia backstory is so interesting that it pales in comparison to a story about a whimpy 18 year old trying to work hard in a detective agency while overcoming his fears & trauma. So, I never really liked when the Anime swifts focus from Dazai\'s backstory to the present Atsushi\'s story, and even then, it\'s more of Dazai\'s plan than Atsushi\'s growth.\r\nIn Beast, however, Dazai has less of a screentime, which works really well as his ""Mastermind behind the scenes"" character archetype. So, when his reveal about his master plan comes at the end of the story, it just hits differently, unlike in the Anime where it brings Dazai for every solution which just made him kinda boring.\n\r\nBut why does it matter? What did BSD Beast deliver by making one of it\'s dearest & best character as a side character?\r\nWell, it achieved what the Anime couldn\'t quite deliver.\n\r\n""Bungou Stray Dogs : Beast"" is set in an alternate universe, where Akutagawa join the armed detective agency (ADA) and Dazai & Atsushi join the Port Mafia. We follow, Akutagawa Ryuunosuke who lost his sister to the ""Man in Black"" of port mafia and swore revenge on him.\r\nI really liked how much Akutagawa worked as a protagonist. Seeing this alternate version of him in ADA is believable & kinda hard hitting, I particularly liked his interactions with Kenji. Seeing Aku coming to terms with his inner beast is quite inspirational. He went from despising the weak to protecting them. What really surprised me though, is Atsushi\'s character study. Though, it\'s pretty much the same as the parent story, it hits differently. The main reason why Beast works is because, it highlights the rivalry between Atsushi & Akutagawa. There\'s a small section where Aku & Atsu have a normal talk like friends, as they reminisce about the small rewards they used to have in their harsh pasts, it\'s quite sad & wholesome at the same time, and it is my favorite moment in this whole story. The battle between Aku & Atsu in the second half of the story is nail-bitingly intense, as they start to question each other\'s motives and pasts, this clash between these two rivals is what the Anime couldn\'t quite deliver which I always wanted to see and ""Beast"" does it miles better.\n\r\nI initially didn\'t like the artstyle. I like the idea of having an overall dark shade for a darker storyline, but it needed time to get adjusted with. It\'s a shame we didn\'t get to see much of Chuuya (sad day for Chuuya fans) or Akiko (sad day for me).\n\r\nI really like this to get animated more than the parent story. It\'s dark, intense, does all things right that the main storyline couldn\'t do and will probably be my favorite in the whole franchise.']"

Thankfully, Yagate Kimi ni Naru (Bloom into You) avoids these issues, placing well-written characters into an engaging and thoughtfully crafted narrative to create a moving coming-of-age story.\n\r\nStory (10/10): YagaKimi presents a believable and well-paced narrative that takes readers on an emotional journey of self-discovery as an unlikely friendship blooms into love, while exploring socially important issues such as loss, loneliness, gender roles, and the meaning of love itself. No event\n                  ...\never feels out of place or rushed, and each one feels relevant to the overall story. The last few chapters provide a satisfying conclusion.\n\r\nArt (10/10): The artwork is very well-done overall. Characters are expressive and have unique designs, backgrounds have an appropriate level of detail, and everything is drawn in a very consistent manner. It's a pleasure to look at.\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): YagaKimi's cast, especially its two protagonists, are by far its strongest aspect. Everyone is treated with respect and interactions between them are powerfully and realistically written.\n\r\nWe are initially introduced to Yuu Koito as an average first-year who isn't sure of her life ambitions or what she wants in a relationship, and to Touko Nanami as the ideal student council president who falls in love with her kouhai. However, over time it becomes clear that there are many more layers to both protagonists than is initially apparent. Their desires, backgrounds, and mental states are thoroughly developed and examined over the course of the story, and this allows their interactions to transform from something rather standard into a truly special and unique relationship. These reveals are highly engaging and moving. Because its protagonists’ goals and ideals change as they learn more about what they want from themselves and each other, YagaKimi feels more like a coming-of-age series than a romance at times, and this is more than welcome.\n\r\nOverall (10/10): YagaKimi is a masterpiece that all fans of romance and coming-of-age series, regardless of their opinion on yuri, should read. Its well-developed characters and narrative provide an emotionally rich experience that respectfully depicts lesbian youth in a way few prior series have managed to accomplish. An equally good anime adaptation of the first half has already been produced and I sincerely hope a second season will be made to cover the rest of the story. This is easily the best manga I have ever read, and it is not to be missed.""]"

I may be biased, but I really do think that Fujimoto-sensei has already set the gold standard for mangaka moving forward, and this oneshot is the perfect guide on how he does it.\n\r\nWhat I assumed was just Fujimoto talking about a dead relative turned into a story showcasing his obvious love of\n                  ...\nfilm, and then turned into a manual on how to move past loss and regret. Sprinkle some deadpan comedy into it and you have the perfect formula to get you attached to Yuta, Eri, and Yuta\'s dad.\n\r\nEver since his old one-shots, he\'s always geared towards normal, human stories with ""a pinch of fantasy"", and not only has he doubled down on it, he perfected the formula. The story comes to a close with a confusing-- for lack of a better term, parallel to the in-universe film that Yuta shoots. This just ties everything together so much more. This is without a doubt his most ""complete"" work. Even Look Back could\'ve used a couple more pages to explore the character relationships. The formula seems to be nailed in here, though. 200 pages for a one-shot is insane, especially when you take into account how most tankobons fall just under that number even with the added extras.\n\r\nThe artwork is fantastic, by the way. The perspectives and use of a motion blur when the story is in ""camera mode"" helps get the message across very well, and the limited paneling does wonders as well. Fujimoto has always loved his empty space and repetitive, quiet panels, but it\'s never been as apparent as it has been here. There\'s a scene where two characters are shown eating at the table, and a couple pages are just dedicated to seeing their eating mannerisms. These may be characters on paper, but moments like that really help get the author\'s points across. It\'s the little things, yknow?\n\r\nFujimoto is here to stay, and we\'re all just along for the ride. I can only wonder what the hell he has in store for Chainsaw Man part 2, and whatever else comes after that.\n\r\nProbably a lot of film talk... and explosions.']"
69,['Tian Guan Cifu'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/140765/Tian_Guan_Cifu,"[""Considering the sizable Mo Xiang Tong Xiu fanbase, I'm surprised there aren't any reviews on this manhua based on her third novel of same title yet. I'm assuming it's because it's incomplete, so I'll break the ice.\n\r\nPlease understand this review is on the manhua up till where it currently has be released in English on Bilibili (we're on volume 5, chapter 70 I believe). I won't give any spoilers from the novel.\n\r\nThis is the highest rating I've given a manga or manhua simply because of one thing: the art. It's gorgeous full colour and stands head and shoulders above any I have ever read. I\n                  ...\ncannot gush more about STARember's style. It (for me at least) is totally unique. The unfortunate thing about illustration trends is that a lot of animation and manga starts to looks similar. TGCF stands out from the crowd. The artist put care, love and attention to detail in ever panel. I can gush a paragraph about how beautifully he renders the colours of the fabric of their garments... but I won't bore you. You get the idea; art = exemplary. \n\r\nThe story, at times, can be confusing if you haven't read the novel. I suspect the artist cut some of the details in order to focus on quality of artwork rather than quantity of panels. The manhua follows several fast-paced, sometimes funny story arcs, all held together with the slow-burning, hauntingly beautiful love story between Xie Lian and Hua Cheng... both whom have been beautifully drawn. Much currently remains a mystery and we haven't yet got to the best story arcs yet, but I so look forward to THE backstory... if you know, you know. All I'll say is that it's achingly painful.\n\r\nThe main characters are incredibly interesting, Xie Lian has lived a tough 800 years without becoming cynical and jaded. His experiences have made him a humble, likeable character. Hua Cheng's character (to date) has not really been revealed... and, as I said, I won't give spoilers except that you'll really want to see more of him.\n\r\nWhen I first read the novel I knew nothing about xianxia or cultivation and spent half my time googling these terms. They are not explained in the manhua, but now the official translated novel does. Having a small index of terms at the beginning of the manhua would have been helpful.\n\r\nI highly recommend TGCF if you enjoy great artwork, are open-minded about BL stories, enjoy Xianxia novels and like long-haired bishies running around in robes. Actually, if you enjoy great artwork just read it, I guarantee you won't regret.\n\r\nI do realise that my rating of 10/10 has been affected by my knowledge of the novel storyline, nostalgia and sentimentality, but trust me... the artwork is 11/10!\n\r\nOh yes, and did I mention just how great the artwork was? 😂""]"
70,['Golden Kamuy'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/85968/Golden_Kamuy,"['Ah yes, the manga where everyone is a black ops special forces commando. The manga where action scenes are short but intense instead of dragging out for 3 chapters. The manga where drama lasts for 2 panels instead of a whole volume plus 30 chapters of unnecessary flashback. The manga where the puns and comedy parts are actually funny. The manga where characters are unique, believable, charismatic, and easy to like. Do I need to continue? The answer is yes. Because no amount of praise can honor the glory that is this manga.\n\r\nGolden Kamui is a story about a war veteran, Sugimoto the Immortal, from\n                  ...\nthe Russo-Japanese war that ends up hearing about a hidden treasure somewhere, that was stolen from the Ainu people. He then sets out to pursue this treasure for the woman he loves. Soon he meets up with an Ainu child called Aspira that has rights to the gold, and the two join up to find this gold and split it. \n\r\nIf it wasn\'t clear already, I\'m going to lay it right out. I love this manga. It is amazing, I love everything about it, it\'s art, it\'s historical background, it\'s puns, the story keeps me engrossed, believe you me folks, this is one of the best manga out there. One of the super rare hidden gems in the gigantic pile of garbage that is everywhere in the manga world. And on that note, lets keep it that way shall we?\n\r\nStory: 10/10\n\r\nGolden Kamui is one of those manga that don\'t try to be more than what it is. The story doesn\'t try to create some grandiose scheme that involves the fate of Japan much less the world. In fact, the story being set in Hokkaido, it stays that way. Furthermore, only a couple of people know about the gold.\n\r\nThe leader of those bandits that stole the Ainu gold is the only one who knows where it actually is, and being arrested, he devises a plan to tattoo the location of the treasure in his fellow prisoners. While being transported, all those prisoners escape and are now all throughout Hokkaido. \n\r\nAnd that leads us to the factions involved. Basically there are three factions trying to get their dirty hands on the gold. Sugimoto and company, the 7th division of the japanese army that is considered to be the elite of the elite, and the heroes of the bakumatsu (basically old samurai dudes). And how are they going to gather all the map fragments together? Well, that is simple, they just need to hunt down the prisoners and skin them. Because apparently that is the most natural thing to do since everyone arrived at the same conclusion.\n\r\nThe story has a good mix of seriousness and goofy moments. Puns are original and fit the setting very well. Every aspect of the story, be it action, drama, comedy, flashbacks, etc aren\'t longer than they need to be. Furthermore, the story doesn\'t rely on cheap tricks to make it interesting.\n\r\nI wouldn\'t be doing the manga honor if I didn\'t mention the amount of research the author must have put into this. Throughout the manga, there will be several parts explaining Hokkaido at the time, the Ainu culture, way of life, tools, and specially the Ainu cuisine. If you were wandering why actions and drama parts that usually take 15 chapters to complete in other manga were short here, well, that is because it is more interesting to know that the brain and eyes of pretty much every single animal in Hokkaido is a delicacy according to the Ainu.\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\n\r\nHere is where this manga shines like a herd of unicorns flying through a rainbow. Characters are unique, with relatable motives even if they are not the most righteous. Furthermore the contrast between the characters is superb. Lets take the first and most obvious example between Sugimoto and Aspira.\n\r\nSugimoto the immortal is a war veteran that got his title because well, he was such a badass that he would go kill russians while being shot, stabbed, you name it. He was pretty much a God in the battlefield. So you can imagine the contrast when someone like him teams up with a little girl from an Ainu village. Not that Aspira isn\'t badass in her own right.\n\r\nFurthermore Sugimoto is the good sort of badass protagonist. Not the generic badass but boring protagonists that most authors try to create.\n\r\nWhile we are at it kids, remember when I said at the beginning that everyone in this manga was a commando? Well that\'s right, everyone is badass. Even the lowest nameless grunt that would be just meat in any other manga is a badass. How badass you ask? Well guess you will have to read it to find out ;) Lets just say that halfway thorough I was questioning myself, as I am sure you will too, ""why is everyone in this mange so badass""?.\n\r\nGoing back to the motives why everyone wants the gold, well all of the motives are actually quite selfish with Sugimoto\'s being possibly the most selfish of them all. So there isn\'t really an antagonist here in the proper sense of the word. Not even a villain actually. It really depends in the point of view.\n\r\nArt: 10/10\n\r\nI usually don\'t like to dwell much on art because it is a matter of taste. But I really find the art of Golden Kamui unique. And not just the drawing. The expression that every character makes is really one of the selling points here. No amount of explanation here can exemplify how amazing it is. Just read it for yourself.\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\n\r\nSeriously, this is the best manga that has come out in the last couple of years, and one of the best overall. I started reading this from chapter 5 and you have no idea how happy I am whenever a new chapter comes out.\n\r\nOverall: 11/10\n\r\nAlright kids, this manga seriously deserves more recognition. But not much more mind you. I  don\'t want the popularity to affect the quality. So, if you were lucky enough to come across it, go read it, it is amazing, but don\'t tell any of your friends.']"

If you are a fan of the movie then I highly recommend reading this novel. There's a lot of internal monologues from the main character in the book that you don't really see in the movie.

73,['Aria'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/81/Aria,"['For the purpose of this review, I’m going to write a review for both people who have watched the Aria anime already, and who have not and are only reading the manga.\n\r\n----\n\r\nReview for those HAVE NOT watched the anime:\n\r\nAria is a very nice and relaxing slice of life manga that definitely deserves reading.\n\r\nOne interesting thing about Aria is that it can be a bit hard to recommend to other people. Basically you follow the 3 main characters: Akari Mizunashi, Aika Granzchesta, and Alice Caroll as they work hard to become great undines… which are basically tour gondola rowers. \n\r\nWhile that might seem a bit odd,\n                  ...\nin the world they’re in, it actually fits pretty well!\n\r\nLike most slice-of-lifes, besides the goal of becoming better undine, there is no big concrete “plot” to follow. Basically every chapter is a new adventure through the relaxing yet mysterious world of Neo-Venezia. A majority of the chapters consist of the main characters interacting with each other, or doing random things that people in regular life do today like visiting a coffee shop. However, there are also a bunch of “supernatural” events that happen throughout the story, and they usually involve Akari and… cats. But they’re still entertaining and they fits well with the fact that Aria is already a whole new world to the viewer.\n\r\nEven if in most of the chapters there is “nothing that happens”, make no mistake, the characters themselves still get a good amount of development throughout the series, and it’s very nice slow and smooth just like the series.\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I would have to say every single one of the characters is very likable, including the minor characters. However, the 3 main characters and their mentors are easily the best characters in the show, and their likable personalities will definitely keep you interested throughout the story.\n\n\r\nOverall, Aria is a very likable manga series with some nice stories, great characters, good character development, and it just knows how to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. I definitely recommend reading it!\n\n\r\n(This is my first review. If you can, If you put whether you thought this review was helpful or not can I have some constructive criticism of why you think so? Thanks!)\r\n----\n\n\r\nReview for those HAVE watched the anime:\n\r\nBasically the majority of the actual content is about the same. There are a whole lot of differences though. A lot of the content featured in Aria the Animation is actually covered in the manga “Aqua”. The character “Ai” was actually a filler character in the anime, and does not appear in chapters where she would normally appear in the anime… except for the last chapter, since the author decided to put her in.\n\r\nThe actual order of the chapters is actually quite a bit different compared to the order the episodes aired in each season. Not only that, but you may get a few chapters that you saw in Aria the Natural then all of a sudden you may get a chapter that was from Aria the Origination or Animation or vice-versa. \n\r\nAs you go through the manga you’ll notice that there are a whole bunch of episodes missing.. that’s because each season had about 3-5 episodes of filler each. \n\r\nAlso, there are roughly 5-8 chapters that were not covered in the original anime. I’m actually a bit surprised that they left these out since all of them were great, but I suppose it may have been a bit hard to find a nice spot to fit them in. Probably the most important one (in my opinion) is a slightly better resolution to the whole “Cat Sith” ordeal. If you wanted more of this particular character, definitely read the manga for this.\n\r\nOne thing that I actually liked about the manga more was that it was a bit easier to read at your own speed, since the anime tends to go a bit slower than the original manga chapters  (however you may or may not agree with me).\n\r\nI’d say if you enjoyed the anime a lot, it definitely would not be a bad idea to read through Aqua than through the Aria manga.\n\r\n(This is my first review.

At its core, Fata Morgana is a tragic love story spanning multiple generations. As the narrative progresses, more and more layers are revealed, unveiling a masterfully constructed literary complexion permeated with myriad nuances and perfectly polished to give the viewer a deep sense of satisfaction when each of its mysteries are uncovered. Each story arc is intricately woven into the overarching plot, leading to a revelation that will leave you awe-struck and emotionally moved.\n                  ...\nThroughout the story, you will be confronted with thought-provoking themes of fate, hope, identity, revenge, forgiveness, and most prominently, love. Its avant-garde method of storytelling was perfectly executed. The prose is poetic, though, unlike a picturesque, Shakespearean tragedy. It\'s raw, harsh, and unembellished. Humans can be deplorable, and Fata Morgana does not hide this fact. Though unforgiving in this regard, the juxtaposition of pure sorrow and unparalleled happiness is what got me invested in the series. The only aspect of this story that people may find undesirable is its slow-paced writing requires much patience. However, this is necessary to build up the story\'s masterful climaxes. \n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 \r\nThe most compelling part of Fata Morgana is its characters. They are complex, multi-dimensional, and beautifully developed. The characterization is subtle yet profound, mainly through small talk and other forms of dialogue. From this process, you eventually learn to know the characters deeply and personally. You understand their idiosyncrasies and characteristics, and they become more than pixels on a screen. You start empathizing with them, feeling their pain, and even crying. Some of my favorite moments in the series were casual small talk. These brief moments of happiness made everything so much more painful to see it all crumble. They may seem insignificant to some, but without them, the story would lose any weight; it would be utterly superficial. But the depth the characters bring to Fata Morgana is what makes it so evocative. The main character, in particular, is my favorite person in all fiction. And not because he\'s perfect; he\'s far from it. But it\'s through his individuality, flaws, and shortcomings and how he tries to overcome them that you begin to see him as a human. The same goes for Jacopo, who, sometimes, isn\'t even a good person. But it\'s through his circumstances and flaws that we see a surprisingly timid man and a great character. Finally, while I can\'t say much about the antagonist, I will say they have one of the most tragic backstories… ever. Overall, I can\'t praise the characters in this story enough. They aptly portray concepts like insanity, grief, greed, and love. The relationships they form are filled with joy and heartbreak, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer long after the book is finished.  \n\r\nVisuals: 9/10 \r\nEverything from the beautiful covers to the fantastic illustrations, this light novel looks great, perfectly complementing the exceptional story. \n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10  \r\nFata Morgana was entirely enthralling; not once did I find myself bored or disinterested, especially towards the latter half of the LN. The suspense was practically palpable, keeping you on the edge of your seat. However, Fata Morgana can be gut-wrenching and hard to read. But while the story is full of sorrow and suffering, that only amplifies and adds more worth to the moments of ecstasy and happiness. After all, a story devoid of tragedy and contention is nothing but a superficial fantasy.\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\r\nThe House in Fata Morgana is an experience. An experience you won\'t see replicated anywhere else in fiction. An experience spanning a millennium. An experience drenched in tragedy and tribulation. An experience permeated by love and joy. It\'s not something you\'ll forget in weeks, months, or even years. It\'s not ephemeral and will leave a lasting impression on those who embark on this journey through time and space, delivering an unforgettable, remarkable literary tale.']"

I've currently read five volumes, and it still remains very interesting. It initially caught my interest after watching the anime, and the novels feel much the same. If you liked the anime, then you'll probably also like the novel. The novels are structured as a collection of short stories that follow a detective format, centered around medicinal themes. While the short stories might seem disconnected at first, they each subtly contribute to and advance the main plot. This makes for nice stopping points, but it can sometimes be a bit frustrating not to know the outcomes of an investigation\n                  ...\nimmediately. Instead, it often only becomes apparent much later in the novel(s), even if it seemed inconsequential at the time. This is part of what keeps the story engaging for me; the other part is to see how the relationship between the main character, Maomaou, and Jinshi develops over time.\n\r\nThe setting is an unspecified era of fictional Chinese history, somewhere with an imperial family. I can't comment on the historical accuracy, but besides the mystery-solving, I find reading about the workings of the palace and Maomaou's daily life in and around the place to be a lot of fun to read as well. The other characters are also engaging to read about, but I'll omit them to prevent spoilers.\n\r\nOverall, this is definitely one of my favorite series.

79,['Pluto'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/745/Pluto,"['Naoki Urasawa, now an established author of pot-boiling epic thrillers such as Monster and 20th Century Boys, delivers again with Pluto, a sci-fi mash-up of Osamu Tezuka\'s Tetsuwan Atom.\n\r\nThis excellent sci-fi revolves around AI robots and dispenses with the explanation of Asimov\'s Law of Robotics for Dummies and just gets right on with entertaining your brain with explorations of the theme of sentient life born from humanity\'s hands.  You\'re either a sci-fi reader and will immediately swim in the narrative, or new to all this and thrash around unknown waters because Urasawa is not interested in holding your hand, he just wants to tell\n                  ...\nthe bold story using the \'World\'s Strongest Robot\' story arc of Tetsuwan Atom as a jumping point.\n\r\nUrasawa even takes a supporting character of the original manga and turns them into the main protagonist, rendering Astro Boy himself into a supporting high profile cameo, and a great one at that.  This entire concept of one artist dipping into another\'s world is fascinating and full of wild possibilities.  Tezuka\'s imaginative universe coupled with Urasawa\'s tension-filled narrative is a joy to read, especially after a few volumes when crisis after crisis befalls characters pushing them to the limit.\n\r\nBlade Runner, I, Robot, Ghost in the Shell, The Animatrix, to name a paltry few, the list is long and varied.  All of sci-fi\'s greatest literature and movies play with these ideas of the relationship between AI/robots and humans, as did Tezuka and as does Urasawa.  But with Pluto there is no vague posturing of whether they can fit into human society, these ideas are already established by the time the story starts.\n\r\nA brilliant decision as there are already many stories about the border between acceptance and antagonism of robots, the threat of their uprising against humanity culminating in apocalyptic war, but not as many stories about robots being treated as valid citizens of countries, with jobs and families of their own, some of them even revered and idolised by the masses while others are disliked for their metallic bodies.  Yes it’s an allegory for race relations, but so is all sci-fi an allegory for something, at least it’s not hackneyed in the hands of a seasoned writer like Urasawa.  (uh, except for a robot-hating character called Adolf, but anyway...)\n\r\nThe backdrop to Pluto is great future-retro design.  Skyscrapers with inexplicable tubes for commuters flowing around and between them, sleek efficient cars wrapped in glass, long roads swirling around cities.  It’s a heightened fantastical futurescape full of idealism.  Urasawa\'s characters are distinguished by their noses as usual, with different races differentiated easily, you dont ususally ever get confused with who is who in his tales.\n\r\nWhat kick-starts this story is when a major robotic figure, loved by all, is murdered brutally.  Fans of Urasawa rejoice, we have yet another exciting mystery with procedural investigation, a cast of many witnesses, suspects, criminals and cameos.  This manga began publication the same year a certain country was attacked and occupied by another, and that event permeates this story, for better or worse is up to you, but its integrated well by tying many threads together into the whole mystery.  The first robot victim that opens the story was one of 7 of the most powerful robots in the world.  Someone is going round bumping them off.  Europol detective Gesicht is on the case.\n\r\nA methodical man troubled by nightmares, he is as brooding as Urasawa\'s previous protagonists yet having the added depth of being a robot himself.  This main character is so great because there is that classic dichotomy and juxtaposition of man and robot, the constant questioning of motive and intent, the internal conflict of the character and the external conflict of his work life and private life.  By robot law instilled into every AI, robots aren’t allowed to take human life, yet all surface evidence of the crimes in the story point that they could not have been perpetrated by a human, so our detective has his work cut out for him to solve the mystery while resolving the issues in his mind.\n\r\nAt heart Pluto is a mystery/crime thriller, and there are great intriguing cliffhangers to each chapter.  We follow Gesicht as he investigates crime scenes, questions people and we also get the occasional and obligatory “regret to inform you” scene which is turned on its head.  You don’t know if you\'re meant to laugh at the blocky metal robot in a kitchen apron being told her husband\'s been killed, but the pathos through dialogue and composition ends up with gravitas.  \n\r\nYou shouldn’t be laughing at our metallic friends; they\'ve got intelligence and emotion as much as their creators.

When some of them die, in their last moments they\'re perplexed by how much humanity they show in death and it’s poignant.\n\r\nSo when Gesicht gives his chapter-one ending statement with steely determination, we\'re firmly in the passenger seat, riding shotgun for some great sci-fi thrills.\n\r\n""I will search for the killer.

80,['Hi no Tori (1967)'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/1325/Hi_no_Tori_1967,"[""It is no surprise that the father of anime, Osamu Tezuka, has written such a perfect manga. As obscure as the series is, Phoenix is one of the best manga series known to the world. The art may be dated but the storyline is what makes this series amazing. Each volume has a different story, but contains the same motif: a struggle to gain immortality. \n\r\nThe first volume came out in the 1960's so the art style is much different than today's manga styles. At first, one may not think this series came from Japan because the characters look a lot like Betty Boop. The\n                  ...\nTezuka's style exaggerates the characters but the backgrounds are drawn nicely. Those who aren't into the Astro boy style may not enjoy the artwork, but you'll get used to it.\n\r\nSome characters are introduced in more than one volume through reincarnations, but most are strictly in one volume. The story jumps from past to future of people trying to gain the phoenix's blood. Each story to each volume is different, which is excellent because it shows how different people wish to obtain the phoenix. Also, it shows Tezuka's creativity. There are many hooks and suspense that make the reader want to read more. There are a variety of characters and their personalities are developed. Though, this series is incomplete due to Tezuka's death, it is still enjoyable. \n\r\nThe volumes are a lot thicker than regular manga, but the price to each volume is only an few extra dollars. It was released in North America recently, so one can easily find it in libraries and bookstores. Two volumes are packed into one for some of the Viz releases, making the series more affordable. \n\r\nThose who like sci-fi, or historical manga would love this series. The artwork may be simplistic and not the greatest, but the storyline is very deep. It's a shame this series hasn't gotten the attention it deserves because it belongs on every manga fan's bookshelf. Be sure to pick it up.""]"

The way the story is presented is so uniquely Umineko that it at times left me speechless about how this particular way of revealing your main mystery hasn\'t been done to this extent before, but to that I will have to say more in the character portion. Alliance still remains my favorite part of this story so far cuz of the emotional connection with Ange I made through it but this one is definitely a close second, so this one also quite easily gets a \r\n10/10\n\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\n\r\nNow one small aspect of Umineko that I am not particularly fond of is the fact that with every part there is always a plethora of new characters added to the already big cast we had prior to said part. With Requiem being no exception from this fact, I rather had my doubts about it before starting and wished it would focus less on new characters and give more proper screen time to the ones that were there from the beginning. \r\nBOY WAS I WRONG ABOUT THAT! \r\nThe character writing was, by far and without a single shred of doubt in my mind, the best thing about this part of the story. \r\nThrough the newly added characters Will and Lion we slowly learn about the main mysteries this story has presented us with over the course of its run:\n\r\n1) Kinzou and Beatrice\'s first meeting as well as the backstory of the Ushiromiya Gold and all it brings with it.\r\nAnd with this story comes my utmost respect for Kinzou, the head of the Ushiromiya household and the mad man constantly rambling on about the occult and Beatrice the Witch, as a character. Seeing his backstory about what happened long long before this story starts presented in such a grounded way was something I never thought I would enjoy as much as I did but here we are with this being one of my favorite parts of the entire manga.\n\r\n2) The identity of the person behind Beatrice the Golden(/Endless) Witch and how her in canon story became what it is now.\r\nThrough the above mentioned carefully crafted backstory of our culprit we get one of the most graceful and respectful ways to reveal and resolve a mystery ever, both to the readers as well as to the characters in the story while giving so much focus to JUST the one character and her connections to the ""magic world"". The way they were put to rest through the battle with Will (man I like Battler but I wish we had more of Will in the previous parts too) with them going through all the games played and reveal each and every  answer to how it all was done is probably my absolute favorite thing all of the parts up to here have done so far, and I\'ve come to love a few of the characters, especially the servants much more than I did before.\n\r\n3) The Truth about the incident on Rokkenjima of October 4th and 5th 1986.\r\nWell, we got this one mostly through Ange and Lion put at the end of Requiem and the only thing I gotta say is: Damn, how can the part that is probably the most grounded in reality and the calmest also be the most f\'ed up of the whole thing with the tea party chapters at the end there.\n\r\nNow to not have this portion end up too long, the last thing I\'d like to say about the characters, that is in general and not limited to this part, is that I wish that not all the parents or parent figures would be such over the top a-holes or kinda just bad parents, like how F\'ed up is it that the best parent figure (aside from the servant Kumasawa) is the guy who banged and had a child with his own daughter. Think about that for a moment; and with a please never change, Japan, never change I also bestow a score of \r\n10/10 for the characters in this part, simple because it managed to absolutely deliver on everyone it focused on.\n\n\r\nART: \n\r\nThe art is still my good and precious Umineko art and now, unlike Part 4, I get to have my magical black and ""golden"" background whenever the scenes outside of the gameboard play again so I am rather happy about that. Without much else to say, it is not the best art I\'ve seen in manga but it is pretty high up\r\n9/10\n\r\nTo stay in the technical aspect I also listened to the OSTs for this part too which is surprisingly amazing, yet much much calmer than its predecessors and I had a great time reading while listening to it, obviously not to the right track for every corresponding scene but hey, still.\n\r\nENDING/CONCLUSION:\n\r\nNow one of the things I always take into my rating of anything I watch and read is the ending, or the conclusion, of the story being presented to me. Despite this not being the actual ending of the entirity of the story I feel like this did an incredibly good job answering most of the questions that have been set up over the course of all of the previous parts and with the ending we got with Battler coming back in again for Ange, I am very curious on what Episode 8 is gonna be, because I have literally zero clue as to what I should expect, also given that it is many readers\' favorite part. So with me gushing on about this for basically all this review, I\'ll give the conclusion to this one a \r\n9/10\r\nthough I personally still can\'t wrap my head around why so many people love Bernkastel, maybe I\'ll know by the end of part 8.\n\r\nENJOYMENT/EMOTIONAL IMPACT\n\r\nI think by now you all now that I absolutely love this manga, and as much as I want to give this aspect a full score, because I simply cannot connect in any way with a lot of the parents characters and especially not with Bernkastel the Witch of Miracles I have to subtract at least a few points for this here. \n\r\nOverall my score for Requiem of the Golden Witch comes down to a 9.5/10, given that it is far better than most of the previou parts and only topped by Alliance which I overall also gave a 9.5.\n\r\nI am very curious to see what awaits me in Episode 8 and how this whole thing ends, but until then (which will probably be in the next 2 days given I read this one in the span of a bit less than 3 days) I bid you adieu and wish you all a belated happy new year 2022']"
82,['Violet Evergarden'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/98930/Violet_Evergarden,"['After reading this 3 times, I decided to update this review a bit.\n\r\nBefore I start, if you\'re wanting to know more from watching the anime, I\'ll tell you this: the anime has done what the novel hasn\'t and vice versa. Basically, reading the novel won\'t guarantee what you want to know.\n\r\nEven though my expectations were very high before I read this, it still managed to surprise me in every single chapter (not necessarily in a good way). This novel has the power to play with your emotions to such extent that you end up thinking about what you read for weeks, let alone days. The\n                  ...\nreally descriptive narration enables the reader to picture the scenes perfectly, as if he/she was really there. \n\r\nStory: 9\n\r\nPositives:\r\nThis is a beautifully crafted story, pretty good to be the first work of Akatsuki Kana, I do sincerely hope she writes more stories. The story is mainly set in a country called Leidenschaftlich. Violet travels around the world to help her clients express their feelings to their receivers. Along with that, she learns to understand their emotions as well, ultimately to comprehend something someone important to her said a long time ago.\n\r\nAlthough the idea of someone finding the meaning of ""I love you"" is one that has been  explored quite often before, the method used to find this complex emotion\'s meaning is unique. By writing letters for other people, Violet learns the meaning of emotions other than love as well, as she encounters different people in different situations with different feelings to be conveyed to their receiver.  And by doing this we also get to know the lives of those people as well. \n\r\nUnlike being in a boring chronological order, the novel starts in a very unusual way: we see Violet carrying out her normal duties as an ""Auto-Memories Doll"" for the first 5 chapters. We don\'t get much information about her past, and we only get some slight clues that she was a former soldier and seems to be following someone\'s orders. I liked the structure a lot because I\'m the type of person who likes stories which start somewhere unexpected.\n\r\nEach of the 5 chapters are very interesting. They persuade the reader to become very attached to the characters (other than Violet), by showing their pasts in depth and the letters they tell Violet to write. It\'s as if they\'re one of the MCs as well. Now the best part about each chapter is that they all have an emotional ending, which never stops from boring the reader. The novel constantly shows completely unrelated, new adventures set in completely different places. \n\r\nLater on we get a glimpse of the Violet\'s past. I think I liked these chapters the most in the novel. The development of Gilbert\'s feelings, who cared for her during the war, from a parental love to a different form of love was amazing to me. The depictions of the battles were very detailed and rich too, and emphasized a lot of the contrast between Violet\'s beauty and the horrible damage she caused to her enemies. She was basically presented as a killing machine. The idea of Violet being a \'tool\' or the fact that she is described as \'it\' was effective in carving in the reader\'s mind her inhuman nature. \n\r\nAfter that, well it\'d be going in too much in the story so I\'ll stop. I\'ll just say that the last chapter was truly great, almost like a fairy tail.\n\r\nNegatives:\n\r\n1. Violet\'s beauty was highlighted so much I can almost memorize her description... Here\'s one of numerous examples:\n\r\n""Her soft, braided hair was held by a dark red ribbon, while her slim body was enclosed in a snow-white ribbon-tie dress. Her pleated silk skirt swayed gracefully as she walked, the emerald brooch on her chest glittering in sparkles. The jacket she wore over the dress was of a contrasting Prussian blue. Her long leather boots, worn for practicality, were of a deep cocoa brown.""\n\r\nI don\'t know whether you\'re the type of person who likes description which are all glittery like this, but I did think that mentioning her beauty almost every single time whenever Violet appeared was quite annoying, and felt like a waste of lines.\n\r\n2. The novel completely skips Violet\'s development in becoming a doll and any kind of recovery from Gilbert\'s situation. I was pretty disappointed with this, because it made the story feel a bit disjointed. They were pretty important parts of the story ...\n\r\n3. If you\'re the type of person who values how battles are presented, then you might not like this. I was particularly disturbed by the fact that one of Violet\'s main weapon is a huge battle-axe, almost twice her height. It just didn\'t make sense for me for Violet to use this weapon so efficiently. But then again this is fiction, and since she is OP...\n\r\nNow this is just what I thought of the story. It is debatable that the separate stories are not useful because they focus a lot in the customers. But I think it\'s better than having none. After all, there are some indications in most chapters about Violet\'s development, even if they are just slight hints. \n\r\nArt: 10\r\nYou guys should know this (well most of you should). If I could only give more than 10... I mean the covers are so beautiful I can\'t describe it in words... One of those times when you say to yourself, ""I wish I could live in that world."" I honestly would.\n\r\nCharacter: 9\r\nViolet\'s development is focused a lot, especially her transition from a \'tool\' to a more humane person. You could even say the types of emotions which are learnt in each of her adventures. By learning them, she gets closer to understanding what Gilbert told her. However, as I said before, it isn\'t perfect: we don\'t get any development of her actually becoming a doll.\n\r\nIt only increases my curiosity as to why she was left in that island alone, and why she only understood the word \'kill\' when she was first discovered. They didn\'t provide a single reason for that. I think this was another one of this work\'s weaknesses.\n\r\nGilbert\'s development is pretty good too, from his family\'s strict rules and their tradition of being close with the army to his strong determination to protect Violet no matter what, and going beyond that point. Hodgins was a slightly mysterious character to me. We are shown quite a lot of his interactions with Violet as well, presenting him as a protective guardian, but not much about himself other than the postal company he founded.\n\r\nThe main thing I was disappointed about the novel was the lack of development of side characters like Cattleya, Lux and especially Benedict. I think they were introduced a bit too late in the novel to get enough attention. They still felt like unknown characters to me by the time I finished reading this novel, but I guess that\'s just me moaning about how short the novel was.\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\r\nI definitely enjoyed this novel to the fullest (despite some negatives) and I would strongly recommend this novel to anyone who liked the anime.\n\r\nOverall, this deserves a 10.']"

One thing that stands out the most is the relatability which you can have with the characters, knowing you're into something for the love of it and still not being good enough is something that most humans can relate to. Another aspect this manga covers very well is the interaction between characters and how that affects each of them. I would say the rambling about artistic aspects of the pricing of schools is a bit annoying but it's a necessary evil to understand the severity and the work needed.\n              ""]"
84,['Gintama'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/44/Gintama,"[""Ah, Gintama. One of the best and most complete current manga in Jump. Its premise is intriguing and unique (aliens in historical Japan? Who would have thought it?). It has great characters--ranging from the diabetic lazy samurai Gintoki to the samurai who has a mayo addiction Hijikata to the stalker ninja Sa-chan and so on. All of them blend together well without feeling out of place and flat. No matter where Sorachi puts them in, they always get at least one huge guffaw from me. Its brand of comedy doesn't consist only of repetitive and sometimes obscure references, but it's also a very satirical commentary\n                  ...\non Japanese society reflected in feudal Edo. Though Gintama is first and foremost a gag manga, with all chapters merely snippets of the Yorozuya's different interactions with themselves and other people in the Amanto (Gintama's term for aliens)-filled Edo, Sorachi Hideaki manages to slip in a few serious action arcs to show a little semblance of an actual plot. And when he does, he brings his A-game. All serious arcs in Gintama are great, they either keep you on the edge of your seat eagerly anticipating what happens next or reduce you to a bawling little girl with every sudden sad twist. Sorachi Hideaki definitely is a master at balancing hearty laughs with testosterone-laden action and heartwarming drama without it feeling shoehorned in to the story. Gintama is already an awesome manga but it could use an improvement in the art department. Don't get me wrong, I'm no art connossieur, but sometimes the characters look stiff and hastily done but other than that there really is nothing to complain about. Comedy and action rarely mix together well, but in Gintama it does perfectly. With well-written storylines and almost uncanny comedic sense, Sorachi Hideaki's Gintama should not disappoint. GO. READ.

85,['Mo Dao Zu Shi'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/121405/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi,"['On paper, the story sounds interesting. I’m sure many people actually enjoyed it. But for me, I had to constantly force myself to keep paying attention. So keep in mind this is more of a personal rant rather than an attempt at objective review.\n\r\nFirst, to give some context: I’ve seen some wuxia series, but I’m still fairly new in the genre. I’ve read my fair share of BL, but rarely do I actually like any of it. And lastly, this is one of the first Chinese novels I’ve read. Yes, this is going to be relevant. \r\nNow, an attempt to explain the reasons for my\n                  ...\ndisenjoyment: you see, the three main aspects of this novel are all that aren’t exactly friendly to readers that aren’t already fan of the categories, and two of them make the work straight out confusing if you aren’t. First, the two confusing ones – Chinese novel, and wuxia. The writing style is just… weird. Maybe it’s just a style of a different culture that I’m not much familiar with, but it’s quite hard to keep track of not just the story but even the sentences itself. If feels like it’s written in a style that is both overly complicated and somehow lacking the artistic poetry value of good writing. Imagine something like a young adult novel but the author attempts to emulate speech pattern from the original Beowulf. And apparently that’s normal for Chinese fantasy novels, or so I’ve been told.\n\r\nNow, wuxia. If the language wasn’t already reader unfriendly, the wuxia tropes would make the text such anyway. I know, I know, the original audience is assumed to be familiar with concepts such as cultivation, Confucianism etc., but again, I’m writing about my personal experience and despite some familiarity with Eastern philosophies I still felt like the novel made almost no attempt to explain its worldbuilding, as it too common with wuxia stories. Stuff just… happens. Sure, I guess it might be weird if a western work would set aside some time to explain what are zombies, dragons, fireball etc., but when almost every sentence in the novel reads like “Grand Wiseman Xiung-Zhe ascended the Mountain of Three Grievances to cultivate a Cheese Tree Spirit that would end the patriarchs of Seventh Day Advent Hoppist sect so that Smol Dik Xian may reign again” (with it being the first time the reader sees most of the names mentioned), it’s very hard to pay attention and almost impossible to develop any care for the story. Maybe there are some interesting plotpoints under all that buzzword spam, but I’m surely not one to spend the time trying to find them. I like books that I can lose myself in, that transport me inside of them, not books that make me stop after each sentence. \n\r\nAnd finally, the BL aspects. I’m not saying that BL can’t be good, but the standard of what passes as a story can be… quite low. However, Mo Dao Zu Shi is surprisingly fine in this regard. Which is to say, there would be a story even if you took the yaoi out of it, which is more than I can say about the average boy love title. Well, sometimes it does feel like the author can’t decide whether to focus on the story or on the pretty boys. This difference is most seen in the side stories where after the pretentiously high-sounding main plot, once you get to the sexual side of things the dialogue changes to style that sounds like the author just found out about the existence of the word “fuck” (or maybe I should blame the translator for that, honestly it sounds plausible for either of them being at fault). But well, it is the genre.\n\r\nTo summarize: if you like BL and wuxia, you will likely like this. If you like just one of those, it might still work out. However if you don’t care about neither BL nor wuxia, I really can’t recommend this one. But hey, try it out for yourself and see, maybe I’m the only one who feels this way.']"

And yet Certain Magical Index is a novel that keeps on giving. What started as somehow simple (yet still original) concept of interactions between magic and sci-fi has long expanded into something much more elaborated.  \n\r\nBut well, if you\'re reading a review for the third series of the novels, you\'re most likely already somehow acquainted with this franchise and the world of Index. You\'re most likely just checking on how the newest entry is doing. Worry not, it\'s doing great, at least so far. What I really like about Index is\n                  ...\nhow it still manages to surprise me even though the power of the protagonist is really simple and only reactionary (well, on a paper) and let\'s be honest, it ultimately keeps following the same formula of Kamijou beating people up. Keyword here being ""almost"", as it\'s those little tweaks and turns that make the series enjoyable to read. By this time I really expected for Index to become repetitive bullshit and I\'m glad to be able to say my expectations were wrong. \n\r\nAnother notable thing is how Index deals with plot armors. Kamijou might seem as having one, but that is not the case - not only he has to frequently suffer on the way to his goal as the miraculous victories aren\'t gifts free of change, it also just doesn\'t feel plot-armorish at all. It\'s not that the plot gives Kamijou armor, it\'s Kamijou who will keep punching not just Gods but the story itself until it gives him a way to follow his selfishly selfless goals. \n\r\nAlthough the new series starts with some light comedy that did manage to get some chuckles out of me, it quickly turns into one of the most serious-feeling arcs in the novel (the author really just keeps one-upping himself, doesn\'t he?) in which the strong points mentioned above truly shine as the scale of the story continues to expand.\n\r\nEven with just two volumes out at the time of writing this review, Genesis Testament is off to a stellar start and I hope it will keep it up with further continuation.']"

88,['Banana Fish'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/756/Banana_Fish,"['During the Vietnam War in 1973, an American solider goes insane and starts gunning down his allies and friends. After killing off a majority, we see that he has gained a form of dementia, and keeps repeating one line, over and over: “banana fish”. This manga was created by Akimi Yoshida (who also made Kisshō Tennyo) back in 1985, and it\'s the most manly shoujo to date. In fact, Frederik Schodt, popular translator (whose works include Phoenix, and Rose Of Versailles) remarks that it\'s “...one of the few girls\' manga [a]...male adult could admit to reading without blushing.” The series, Banana Fish –which ran until\n                  ...\n1994 with a total of 19 tankobon volumes– now remains one of 50 best classic manga of all time.\n\r\nIt\'s very hard to say how the plot, narration, and pacing came about in Banana Fish. Even as you begin the manga, the overwhelming intensity is just there, even if any characters haven\'t been fully introduced. It is certainly not a straight-forward series: there is no “beginning”, no “rising action”, no “climax”. As it chronicles and documents the lives of NY gangs (and gang warfare), it does so extremely realistically. It can fluxuate between something that can only be described as “tension, strain, bombs, and anxiety” and a calm, relief-filled respite. This is easily the best part of Banana Fish: there is no filler, and the way it goes about presenting the story is invigorating and interesting. The plot is air-tight.\n\r\nAs a result of such an amazing plot line, we are also given the characters, along with the development that comes along. There is no “real” main character in this, as there are several ones that are heavily expanded on. But that\'s not the amazing part about it. All major main characters are introduced extremely early on (and no, there isn\'t a problem about memorizing names here!). There is no character in this introduced for the sake of plot. There is no Person XYZ who can offer a solution to the problems they face. Oh no. All major characters are given three dimensional personalities (along with some sort of backstory that is frequently talked about and expanded on) and they all have inner, realistic struggles which can apply to most of us. In short: yes, they\'re pretty great.\n\r\nAsh Lynx, as an example, is the head of his  gang. Blunt, rude, and often recognized as juvenile, we are led to believe that\'s all we should expect. But that\'s not so. Although he has killed, he is no heartless thug. It\'s important to note that, although he\'s got years of trauma under his belt, he is still the softest gang leader out there. The tough cynicism he takes on conceals a wish to be treated as a normal human being, for he has never wanted the life that Dino Golzine has given him. In contrast to him, we\'re introduced to Eiji Okumura (who is equally as interesting): a fresh-out-of-highschool althete who has travelled to New York to be a photographer\'s assistant. But that kind of description doesn\'t do him justice.\n\r\nAlthough I won\'t say that every single one of the characters are memorable, but a great amount of the complex ones are.\n\r\nThe atmosphere and the setting in Banana Fish is spectacular. I, myself, haven\'t lived in NY, but the amount of time and research that went into understanding the city as a whole is great. It wasn\'t just some label stuck on the city to make it feel pretentious or whatnot, I mean, I\'m sure some of us have read a manga that use NY as a foreign city to make it seem \'cooler\', but this was not the case. Banana Fish made me feel like I knew NY (and I probably really don\'t, so that is just a testament to the incredible, “slummy” atmosphere Banana Fish created). It was the little things: actual street signs, large neighbourhoods, or building complexes in relation to certain areas. And it wasn\'t just NY that was researched, there was also the nature of drugs, which is a key plot point. The planning and effort were used to their fullest during the creation of this manga –brilliantly.\n\r\nDespite how many times I\'ve said how good this is, what really stands out is the fact that it was made for girls (as it was serialized in Betsucomi). Although Banana Fish can be easily treated as a seinen (or a mature shounen/josei) it is probably best read as shoujo. This manga is proof that, although most modern shoujo are bad, classics (or “hidden gems”) of shoujos still hold promise. Reading this can drastically change one\'s opinion on shoujo for the better, which is amazing on it\'s own. Not only that, but this manga holds tons of historical value to the 80\'s and 90\'s, as it was extremely popular in Japan. Back in 1998, the japanese magazine Comic Link hosted a poll for the ""50 Best Manga"", and unsurprisingly, Banana Fish ranked #1.\n\r\nThat kind of respect and praise definitely holds merit in the manga world today.\n\r\nTo be completely honest, there were some minor nitpicks I had when reading this, but by the time the final few volumes came around, the mangaka, an experienced professional, had not only noticed them, but also fixed/rectified them. And they weren\'t even “problems” per se; the criticisms I had were just some minor things I thought would give the manga that extra edge. And it did.\n\r\nCertainly, there should be no disagreement. Banana Fish is a gritty, detail-oriented masterpiece, as well as a big milestone. Lines such as “Know how to use a M-16?” to “He\'s got a grenade launcher!” will not be found in shoujo today, which makes Banana Fish just that much better. There is a little something for every kind of manga reader to enjoy in this (and yes, I may be specifically looking at you fujoshis). So without a doubt, it gets a full 10.0/10.0 from me. Definitely, definitely check this title out; I really don\'t know what else could be said.\n\r\nAnd finally: I will put a warning on this manga, as there is harsh rape and paedophilia portrayed; so caution to younger readers.\n\r\n★★★★★★★★★★\r\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.']"

Well, can be a fun watch for people who like the genre too of course, but if you’ve grown tired of the overused tropes and carbon-copy protagonists this one is a nice change. \n\r\nThis is a tale of a dysfunctional dungeon party and the chemistry between the characters is what makes the series so enjoyable. Starting with the main character who is a lazy, unmotivated, good for nothing, cowardly and with personal gain as the primary goal. In other words, actually relatable protagonist. Next in line we have a goddess with negative IQ that others thinks\n                  ...\nis crazy for claiming she’s divine, a literal meat shield tank whose masochism is levelled much higher than any close combat skills and a dps who is completely useless except for being a portable nuclear explosion with a 24h cooldown. There is not one properly heroic among the protagonist, just a bunch of lovable defects with a writing that sneers at traditional isekai stories.\n\r\nIt is thanks to this that Konosuba achieved such entertaining chaotic energy and reading it feels like riding a train with no brakes on planet comedy. Now of course, comedy is quite subjective matter, which is why the genre is more difficult to review than others. Just trust me that it’s not common for books to make me laugh out loud and Konosuba did precisely that numerous times. I’m amazed by how it keeps inventing hilarious situations with character flaws that could be seen as one trick pony if used wrong.\n\r\nNow, there is one small problem and that is the finale of the last volume. Before it was even translated there were already leakers calling it weird and disappointing, and claiming it ruined the series. So I was understandably worried as I picked it up and as I was reading through it. Thankfully, those worries were entirely unfounded and I have no idea what was there for people to dislike. The finale stayed true to the Konosuba spirit with no derailing and gave me some good laughs.\n\r\nSo, this is a series I wholly recommend. Unless you hate fun or something.']"

92,['Dungeon Meshi'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/85781/Dungeon_Meshi,"['Dungeon Meshi has been a wonderful, overwhelmingly well-orchestrated rollercoaster of emotions; one I just couldn\'t get tired of.\n\r\nIt started as a relatively simple (at least that was the impression) sword-and-sorcery parody meant to deconstruct the concept of eating monsters. It really is disgusting if you think about it for a moment, isn\'t it? Would you love to eat a rabid dog chasing you, or a snake about to bite you? That\'s the kind of mental struggle the characters had to go through at the beginning.\n\r\nAnd it would be perfectly alright if it had stayed just that: a comedy around eating disgusting things. But the story\n                  ...\neventually evolved into a compelling adventure where the procurement of food is not a comedic gimmick, but a unifying theme around which characters are exposed and relationships develop. And the best part? By the way you make it to the halfway point, you begin to realize everything has been planned and foreshadowed from the very beginning.\n\r\nIt bears repeating that Ryoko Kui is an incredible talent. She is very well-versed in both human and animal psychology, and the command she has over her characters is undeniable. Their interpersonal dynamics are some of the best I\'ve ever seen in any story. They feel familiar but don\'t conform to any stereotypes; they are completely distinct from each other but have instant onscreen chemistry. And their behavior is one hundred percent convincing, true to established character traits and informed by their past experiences.\n\r\nThese experiences are the key to everything, and I can\'t get enough of the grace and finesse with which every character\'s development is presented. Every event the party goes through has long-term consequences. Every little thing remains in their memory as the author is meticulously tracking every aspect of the dungeon\'s closed ecosystem. A bar of ""very good"" soap is lost in volume 1, which is noticed in volume 3, and then it is found in volume 7, leading to a bath scene, leading in turn to another bonding experience for the party. The author will never fall so low as to beat you over the head with verbal descriptions of the characters\' growth: she just shows you the gradual progress as it happens, both cause and effect, and trusts your intelligence to connect the dots. It\'s depressing how rarely I see authors in traditionally pop-entertainment genres show so much respect for the audience.\n\r\nThe exact same reverence is given to the setting. Although it can be easy to dismiss it as another banality inspired by Tolkien and Dungeons and Dragons, that would be missing the forest for the trees: the depth of fantasy and mythology lore explored and the precision of weaving it into the setting is well on par with the best works in the genre (and I\'m not talking just about manga!) and opens new perspectives even for die-hard fantasy fans. The dungeon inhabitants\' physical attributes are articulated in a unique style and follow the internal logic of the story. Kui has a *lot* of shorter stories and random designs showcasing her love for mythical creatures.\n\r\nThis goes lengths to show passionate research put into it and makes for a lot of interesting and often gut-busting interactions among the cast. And the fact that no experience is ever truly lost with the group leads to a lot of sitcom-like comedy that naturally emerges when well-written, quirky characters are put together in any sort of unusual scenario. The humor emerges naturally from their personalities and the audience\'s memory of their past experience. Organic setups pay off all by themselves, just like that. Very few stories ever end up in such a desirable state!\n\r\nThe visual comedy is further punctuated by beautiful art. Ryoko Kui isn\'t just a great writer and fantasy buff—she\'s also an amazing artist and character designer. You can always infer a character\'s emotions by looking at their face, allowing for both much tighter comedic timing and more diligent adherence to the \'show, don\'t tell\' principle. The designs themselves are fantastic; they\'re never cutesy in the typical moe way, they are highly physically-accurate, and they grow on you so much you wouldn\'t want to change them for anything. Even orcs look appealing in their own way. If you can gain access to volume releases and supplementary materials, there are pages upon pages of top-tier designs, such as imagining the same characters as different sex or fantasy race. And yeah, there\'s not even a hint of deliberate fan service. The author evidently respects her craft far too much to pander and compromise the narrative\'s tone and message just for titillation; instead she opts to engage the audience by the means any good story should. And engage it does.\n\r\nThroughout it all, Dungeon Meshi never abandons its food focus: all the monster dishes are unique, original, look hella tasty, and always feel appropriate for the circumstances. Again, the range is incredible: it\'s used as a comedic relief after a tense situation, to make a point by one character to another, to assert a victory over a tough enemy, to soothe a troubled heart... What seemed like a mere fun gimmick at first has proven to be a potent narrative tool that subtly enriched the story without forcing it into a repeating formula.\n\r\nIf all of that sounds like I\'m just endlessly heaping praise upon this manga, well, it\'s because that\'s exactly what I\'m doing. It\'s *that* good. It starts out unassuming and then just keeps punching far above its weight while making it look effortless and not messing up in the process. It sucks you in before you even realize how good it really is in everything it does. It\'s a rare miracle of a fun and endearing adventure story about a tightly-knit, lovable group of characters on a quest to save their friend and explore the intricacies of self-sustenance in a dungeon, with incredible art and a satisfying ending. And I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone.\n\r\n(Trigger, pls, make the adaptation deserving of the source material!)']"

Such individuals are male or female because the title of witch applies to both genders. Using a special type of ink, magic is drawn rather than being cast with voice or song. Different patterns represent different spells and they are often cast in secrecy. Why? To prevent the misuse of magic in the hands of the naive. If magic is used in such\n                  ...\nhands, the consequences are detrimental, enough to take away the lives of others or cause great harm to many. Magic is a power that requires the responsibility that comes with it.\n\r\nRealizing her love for magic, Coco bought a magic book and a pen with the ink that can be used to cast spells from the mysterious witch. And thus she enjoyed watching magic ever since, yet just seeing it didn't satisfy her curiosity. What exactly is magic then? And more importantly, how could it be used?\n\r\nWhen a flying chariot comes by her house and breaks down with the meddling of two boys, she gains a chance. Flying chariots cannot fly on their own and require a spell to be fixed if they are broken. Once of the individuals who visited her house for cloth was a male witch known as Qifrey. Witches are known by the pointed hats they wear and he carries one with him.\n\r\nHe casts a spell within her house and by coincidence or perhaps by fate, she realizes how magic is cast. Using ink and patterns, spells become real. Ignoring his warnings to not look inside, Coco has the necessary knowledge to cast. Realizing that she had the tools to draw magic for years, she copies the shapes in her book with her wand with the tip of a pen.\n\r\nHowever, the consequences of her actions cost her greatly, at the cost of a life dear to her.\n\r\nIntroduced as the very beginning, he enters the shop of Coco's mother to buy smoke-colored cloth. Perhaps it is for another uniform or for something else, it is never clarified.\n\r\nWith just how busy the shop is, with noblewoman from the flying chariot looking at the hanging lace, the tidy trim, the Harian knitted lace and more, Coco takes his measurements for him. Gazing at the cloth with a practiced eye after setting it on a table, she smooths it out and making a hole, cuts a straight line across, in a completely accurate fashion, showcasing her concentration and skill.\n\r\nHe admires her skill and then the flying chariot breaks down. Revealing his identity as a witch, he enters Coco's house to recast the spell on the chariot.

At first, you could take a close glimpse how visualizing and stunning the art express more aesthetic tone and the story within it's chapter focuses over more subpar witchcraft elements. Twice as simple where it granted to be a lot philosophic theme about witches. However, more than the basic story, what enraptured me was the artwork itself. Every panel, every composition and transition seems like a true work of art, a piece that one would hang up on the wall. Not of the traditional style of shounen or shoujo, but like that of a painting. \n\r\nMagic express which invoke the inner aspects more than saving peoples lives other than gaining a miracle.

That’re twenty years later, now reminiscing and remembering the good and the bad memories they’ve had and made. Now what makes this completely different and unique, is how the story goes and it’s pacing in particular. It isn’t that special or really different but overall how it shows you the scenes and how captivating it is. Like really, you’d only understand me if you’ve read the manga. \n\r\n~ Thoughts ~\n\r\nFirst\n                  ...\nand foremost, this really messed me up inside and out. I’ve said this the second time already, yet I’ll say it again. You’d get heavily and emotionally invested with it’s characters and it’s conflicts and overall the story. Which is also really something to take note of.\n\r\n~ The characters ~ \n\r\nI’d have to say, each and everyone one of them is unique and isn’t shallow. They have depth. They have emotions and interests. They have their likings and whatnot. They’re characters that’re people who felt really real. Like the Young Toranosuke whos’ having the dilemma of Juvenile love. Troubled so heavy in confessing and having the hand of the beautiful Servant Kaoru. The main couple’s power dynamic is very entertaining. Yet this isn’t the only relationship in the story that is unique and wholesome. Some of it was also very bothersome and saddening. The struggles and strong emotions they’ve had. You can’t help but feel and somehow and somewhat relate also. The characters aren’t simple as they’re quite written decently. Enough to respect the story for what it is and how it goes.\n\r\n~ Illustrations/Art  ~\n\r\nThe illustrations aren’t that particularly special or great. But it definitely did a good job on delivering and maneuvering the characters with their emotions. You can really feel the mood and the situation that they’re in. Which makes the story and the manga overall even better.\n\r\n~ Favorite Scene/Panel ~\n\r\nHonestly, I’d say everything and every simple yet crucial panel of the story. It really hits different when you’re invested whole heartedly. But that would just be crude and ridiculous. So I might have to pick the one where they hold hands and say the title. There’s still a lot of powerful and impactful scenes that I can show but I can only show this. To also avoid spoilers.    .^_^.\n\r\n~ My  Gripes or Critical criticisms/Nitpicking ~\n\r\nAs much as the author did a good job, in my opinion. The story hits you with the same emotional beats, again and again. It’s something to really critically take note of as it shouldn't frequently happen in a story. Because it makes things simple and even bad to others. Like the constant emotional scenes of being worried, sad and crying of the characters. Which is too simple yet still an effective way to make your audience feel emotional. But despite this, it still doesn’t change the fact that I really got hit by it too. Which isn’t too bad. And the author provides a buildup for every conflict and emotional payoff.\n\r\nIf you’ve read all of this, then I appreciate it! \n\r\nWould love to know what you think about the review and the story too!""]"
95,['Suzumiya Haruhi Series'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/3083/Suzumiya_Haruhi_Series,"['Read Vol. 1 - 9\n\r\nHaruhi Suzumiya is a collection of Sci-fi, Comedy themed Light Novels (10 in fact) that fans of the popular anime series would read to get more depth to the story. So there’s really no need to go into detail of the story and overall premise of the Novels. As you may already know the story revolves around an omnipotent high school girl Haruhi Suzumiya, with powers (unknown to her) but told from the point of view of high school boy Kyon (real name unknown).\n\r\nThe anime series only scratches the surface, as it only tells one of the 4 known main stories\n                  ...\n“Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya”. The other 3 being: “Disappearance…”, “Intrigues…”, and “Dissociation…”. Whereas the 1st only focuses on introducing and revealing the main characters and concepts of the story, the other stories tend to go all out in bringing forth complex stories involving time-travel, dimensional rifts and other sci-fi concepts. To help supplement these stories the remaining Light Novels contain episodic mini-events that only loosely follow the main stories. The main problem is the jumbled up nature of these stories and it does require some thinking into knowing the order of events. At least the seasons make it easier to overcome this issue.\n\r\nThe characters are what make these Light Novels worth reading and each of the main characters seem to have purpose into making this an enjoyable read.\r\n-\tKyon the guy that the story follows and it’s his witty comments and cynical attitude that will make him an instant fave.\r\n-\tHaruhi is an eccentric and emotionally unstable girl that causes many problems for Kyon and the rest of the world.\r\n-\tMikuru is a clumsy, well-endowed girl that is there for fanservice and a means of time travel.\r\n-\tYuki is a cute, emotionless alien whose there to rely on whenever something happens.\r\n-\tKoizumi is an esper that doesn’t play much of an active role except when it comes to his long explanations and annoying Kyon.\r\nThe best thing is when you see how each of these characters subtly develops, after a while but still remain a bit of a mystery. What’s also interesting is how the side characters tend to play a major role in the story and at times even become the source of speculation (e.g. Tsuruya).\n\r\nOverall this is a Light Novel that any of the thousands of die hard Haruhiist would enjoy. There’s enough content to keep anyone busy with for a while and for those who like to use that thing called a brain would definitely enjoy it, with all the complex mathematical, physics and sci-fi concept involved. There are quite a bit of dull moments to be found, with excessive explanations and it can be difficult to tell what’s being thought and what’s being said out loud however these issues don’t take away the overall feel of the story.\n\r\n^_^']"
96,['Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/144267/Kaoru_Hana_wa_Rin_to_Saku,"['Just by looking at the cover picture, you can tell it is another ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Delinquent and smart girl"" cliche slapped together. However, the mangaka is able to turn these overused tropes into something amazing and wholesome that other mangas with the same plot simply could not accomplish.\n\r\nThe plot is simple: we start of from the perspective of a delinquent guy, our male lead Tsumugi Rintaro from a low-ranked public high school, coincidentally meeting with a petite girl, our female lead Kaoruko Waguri from a prestigious all-girls high school, at a cake shop owned by Rintaro\'s mom. Both schools are also coincidentally next to\n                  ...\neach other with a unfathomable hatred of each other. It is without a doubt both leads would need to navigate their relationship within the web of animosity between their schools and friends.\n\r\nWhat changes the progression and pacing of this plot lies entirely with the characters, and the mangaka sure does know how to write good characters. Tsumugi, who is portrayed as a scary person on the outside, is soft and kind on the inside. He is able to learn quickly from and correct mistakes he made, intentionally or unintentionally progressing the relationship between him and Kaoruko. Kaoruko, who saw past Tsumugi\'s scary appearance and a love of cake, naturally opened up to him at his family\'s cake shop (for reasons that would probably be explained in the future). What is truly refreshing is that these two main leads are not shy of expressing their feelings and are able to face the obstacles head on whether it be from objections of their social standing or their classmates. The main leads and side character\'s honesty and respect for their values makes this manga enjoyable to read as they develop.\n\r\nThe art is nothing to be scoffed at considering the mangaka\'s first published work. Every character\'s facial expressions are extremely detailed and can invoke heavy emotions, whether they be upset, crying, blushing, or joyful. Every character is also unique and as a reader can easily distinguish who is who. In addition, the backgrounds of each scene are meticulously drawn to give an adequate sense of the setting of each event.\n\r\nWithin the first 10 chapters, there has been more meaningful progression between the relationship of Tsumugi and Kaoruko than other mainstream romance mangas. Although it is easy to see the general gist to what the ending is, I am excited to see how the mangaka will lead the plot to that ending as every chapter has been full of twists and turns, and heavy emotions that is hard to replicate after reading hundreds of the same genre. \n\r\nIf you are a fan of this type of romance genre, I highly suggest you give it a try. Even if you are tired of other mangas overusing these cliches, I would still recommend you try the first two chapters as it sets a solid foundation of what the rest of the manga will be like.']"

U can tell that the artist is very good at sketching cuz even in a soccer match where there are at least 20 characters, the reader can still tell who’s who. \n\r\nPlot: finally no more of the high school sports club troupe.

Once u start reading it u\n                  ...\nget immersed in it and would find urself cheering for the MC or getting frustrated when the team face a challenge. \n\r\nCharacter: The artist does such a good job portraying each character and showing each character’s personality. Each character gets a time to shine, tho of course the main focus remains on the MC. I rly like how the manga focuses on growing by facing ur own weaknesses rather than the typical growing by facing even stronger opponents kinda thing. The MC starts out as a forward, but there is a twist. Not gonna spoil it cuz that would be no fun hehe. \n\r\nOverall: 10/10 would recommend.

And I\'m not using this expression lightly. LoGH is a work that might change your view on some eternal questions and problems of humanity concerning politics and philosophy. Or at least have you rethink your current opinion really hard. It excels at bringing those themes into the story and having it feel so naturally present, almost as if the story is just\n                  ...\na canvas for the ideas (which by no means diminishes the story itself, of course). Those philosophies are presented in a human way, without being overly pompous and without using sesquipedalian and gobbledygook language in attempt to sound more smart, like some rusty philosophical books would do. No, Legend of the Galactic Heroes does not need to pretend, it presents it cleverness straight. \n\r\nTwo main sides are introduced to the reader - two characters, two ideologies. Yet it is up to the reader to decide which one is the antagonist, which one to support and root for and which one deserves to emerge victorious. Those sides are very well fleshed out through the novels, with both their strengths and weaknesses highlighted, neither being idolized and both seen outstandingly realistically. And of course, for those who feel like neither of those sides are good, more minor factions are presented. Reading LoGH feels like the book is conversing with you - presenting you concepts and ideas and abetting you to be their judge. \n\r\nOne thing that I absolutely love about this novel, though some might find it a minor factor, is how well it deals with ""infodumping"". Thanks to being written like a historical record (yes, even though it\'s a futuristic sci-fi), the parts that would normally be considered intrusive to the story flow feel entirely natural to the work, as it is similar to a pleasant narrator of captivating documentary telling you interesting tidbits to give you more context. In fact, it is the fictional version of exactly that. This bypasses the need of ""show, not tell"" for parts that would be too impractical to show in full.\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is a must read not only for those looking for something of ""next level"" to read, but for absolutely everyone.

99,['Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/37707/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso,"['It would seem that feeling some modicum of emotional involvement whilst watching/reading something is all it takes to make a masterpiece these days. Whilst emotional involvement is always a great thing, it\'s not enough to excuse problems that a particular work in question has. On another note, it irks me when people say they ""got the feels"" from watching something because more often than not, it was something stupid/cliché/melodramatic. Maybe I\'m a heartless sociopath or maybe it\'s because I\'ve been through a lot worse in life, but I can\'t help but scoff when people tell me they cried like a baby whilst watching stuff like\n                  ...\nthe first season of Clannad. Then enters Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, an anime/manga series that plagues me with cognitive dissonance because there was no shortage of moments where I couldn\'t help but catch the proverbial feels and yet there were also no shortage of moments where I was irritated beyond all belief.\n\r\nThe main reason why I found myself becoming emotionally involved with Shigatsu in the first place was because of Kousei himself. My own mother is dead, so I know exactly where the poor bastard\'s at and I couldn\'t help but get attached to him. Shigatsu to me was less about the music and was more along the lines of a story about coping mechanisms. Throw in some romance and next thing you know, I\'m hooked! Of course, not everything was perfect and there were minor flaws I noticed here and there that gradually turned into major problems that seriously affected my enjoyment of the series. What was once endearing became tedious and even when it was tedious, there were still bits and pieces of the series I loved the shit out of and it baffles me as to why it had to be like this.\n\r\nThe biggest problem by far that Shigatsu has is all of the psychological monologuing that went on over the course of its run. I said in my anime review that monologues are powerful and if used sparingly, they can further strengthen any emotional impact that a particular scene has and that will always be a fact. Of course, the mangaka (and A-1 Pictures by extension) just doesn\'t seem to understand that more monologues does NOT equal more emotional weight. It just makes those particular scenes increasingly tedious to get through. I wouldn\'t mind this if I actually wanted everything the characters were feeling spoon-fed to me as if I were some emotionally inept otaku with no social skills whatsoever, but I actually WANT to think while I\'m reading or watching. I don\'t understand why mangakas and anime studios think it\'s a good idea to have everyone say exactly how they feel like it\'s some kind of Disney musical, but it\'s a phenomenon that really needs to fucking stop because it just feels condescending as all hell.\n\r\nAnother problem that I have with Shigatsu as a whole is the comedy. I\'m perfectly aware of the fact that levity has a place in storytelling because excess tension tends to build up quickly in stories like this and can quickly make something tedious or just plain uncomfortable to sit through. What\'s more is that Shigatsu is aimed toward a mainstream shonen audience that probably can\'t handle the intensity of stuff like Watashitachi no Shiawase na Jikan. However, Shigatsu\'s particular style of comedic relief irritated me quite a bit whilst I was watching the anime because of the fact that it was so poorly timed. Any sort of drama that being built up was immediately ruined by some poorly-timed visual gag to the point where I found it hard to become invested in what was going on. Now the manga has a lot of these moments as well and whilst it\'s a lot more tolerable in print rather than in anime form, it\'s still something I take umbrage with if only because of the fact that the gag-manga style of levity Shigatsu uses doesn\'t fit with the subject matter it actually deals with. If it were more in-line with the kind of humour shows like Daria used, I\'d be all for that but alack it\'s not and we\'ll just have to deal with that.\n\r\nNow those two problems aside, another thing that never really sat right with me was how Kousei was treated by his friends over the course of the series. He\'s got a dead mother who was pretty damn abusive toward him. The last thing the bloke wants to do is play the piano, and yet he still finds himself drawn to it because you know... that was his thing. I understand his friends want him to just play the bloody instrument again and that 14-year-olds aren\'t psychotherapists by any stretch of the imagination, but the way they go about doing so is rather cruel to say the least. He\'s harassed and manipulated quite a bit over the course of the series and somehow, that\'s the solution to all of his problems. You know, Kousei would\'ve had a mental breakdown if he was a real person because he\'d be forced to re-live some nasty childhood trauma. I wouldn\'t really have much of a problem with this were it not for the fact that I\'ve seen shit like this first-hand, and it *RARELY* works out. It also doesn\'t help that there was a lot of inappropriate gag comedy that was going on during these scenes where Kousei was forced to play the piano again, but let\'s not get into that.\n\r\nWhile we\'re on the subject of 14-year-olds, I can\'t help but feel like this entire ordeal is a bit farcical in hindsight. Don\'t get me wrong: young teenagers are more than capable of experiencing all kinds of intense emotions, but it gets REALLY ridiculous when you have a bunch of 14-year-olds prattling on about ""seeing the notes"" and love and all that shit. The dialogue gets so ridiculous sometimes that it\'s laugh-out-loud hilarious and other times it\'s just flat-out cringeworthy. Maybe if Kousei and Kaori were like college freshmen or something, it would be more bearable but that sadly isn\'t the case. I love my romantic melodramas as much as the next Indian guy who grew up on Bollywood movies, but even guys like me have limits.\n\r\nIf this review sounds more like a long-winded list of complaints than an actual review, I apologise. There\'s a lot of things that people overlook when they talk about this series that it just irritates the shit out of me. It\'s not like this manga didn\'t do anything right from the get-go because that\'s not the case whatsoever. For starters, the concept of a story about a teenager trying to move on from past tragedies whilst learning how to deal with new ones that come on the horizon is something that I just love to no end and in the midst of all the annoying comedy, the tedious monologues, and all the farcical melodrama, there are some great lessons to be found and once in a great while, there comes a powerful scene that would\'ve left you in tears were it not for all the problems I listed beforehand.\n\r\nUltimately, Shgiatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a very flawed series but that certainly doesn\'t mean that it\'s without merit. While it did get a lot of things wrong (and I do mean a LOT of things), what it got right was almost enough to make up for the tedium that was present beforehand. It\'s such a shame that a mangaka like Inio Asano wasn\'t the one who made this series because I get the feeling that if this was something by Asano himself, it would probably end up in the Top 30 here on MAL alongside Oyasumi Punpun. Alas, that\'s not the case at all and we have to put up with what we got. Overall, I give Shigatsu a 6.5/10 (which rounds up to a 7/10). Even though there\'s a good deal of stuff it got right, what it got wrong is just impossible for me to look past. With that said, at least it managed to end on a rather ceremonious note instead of just fizzling out completely like Elfen Lied did. Thanks for reading this review like always. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I\'m out. Peace.']"

Through Willem's desperate attempts to forge his convictions anew and as he confronts his haunting past, SukaSuka questions deeply the duality of good and evil, the frivolity of justice, the purpose of heroism, of choice and predestiny, and how one copes with their most dreaded losses of their loved ones. \n\r\nThis novel scrupulously brought its characters to life with depictions of agonizing emotions and\n                  ...\nintertwining fate. A young soldier who shoulders the survival of an entire civilization professed herself to be a disillusioned maiden desperate for affection; a man-eating troll of bullish strength and unfaltering joviality is but a wearied mother concealing her bitterest regrets; yet more comical, perhaps, was the hulking reptilian whose austere presence masked a compassionate and fatherly tenderness. SukaSuka portrays each of its characters as a meticulously-crafted clockwork of contradictions, illuminating the very passions, insecurities, and paradoxes that encapsulate human nature. The unlikely bonds tethered by the griefs of a motely group of individuals cast its dying world in a warmly glow.\n\r\nAt the corners of my faded memory are the many fables of otherworldly enchantments upon which my very fondness for fantasy was founded. Those were the tales of the tragic Oedipus, of the mighty Heracles and his impossible feats, of the long journeys of the shrewd Odysseus, of Orpheus who was cursed by his own peerless musical talents, or of Eros and Psyche torn apart by their forbidden love. In a similar fashion, SukaSuka is a story that is inspired by the classics, that imitates the classics, that appeals to the readers' penchant for the classics. Reminiscent of the mythologies which had so delicately stolen my juvenile heart, SukaSuka enraptures me as a story that sought to convey itself with the utmost grace and sentiment whereas the reader's enjoyment was secondary - it is a quality which defines timeless literature as opposed to cathartic entertainment. As I witness the story unfold before my eyes, I cannot help but marvel at the author's ingenuity and penmanship. Indeed, SukaSuka is a light novel which is yet to be matched by another of equal caliber. It is, in my heartfelt opinion, nothing short of a masterpiece.""]"

If I could compare this series to another, it would be Akatsuki No Yona off the bat. Although this is a seinen, I felt that it can also play off as shoujo genre as well because of its art style, and the vibe that I got from the first few chapters. I\'ve always enjoyed historical setting in my manga so when I discovered upon this series, oh boy I was so excited. \n\r\nThe protagonist is not just sassy, but also has a very likeable\n                  ...\npersonality that would make the readers fall for her charms. She\'s a little crazy- which the author has done very well in drawing her wicked expressions during those situations. Whenever I see those, I just go ""Oh shit.."" and would be very taken aback. HOWEVER, she\'s also very smart and is very good with her words. She\'s sharp and can read the situation very well, which is something that I find quite refreshing.\n\r\nThe plot of this manga is very interesting. I don\'t think I\'ve come across similar storyline and I think it has a lot of opportunities to develop. It is not your typical girl-in-palace-falls-in-love-with-a-high-ranking-official cliche and has her doctor/pharmacist background as a ""side dish"" to go with the story. Although I would say that I would love to see more of Maomao in her vast world of medicine and poison. If any of you have seen the K-drama ""Dae Jang Geum/Jewel In The Palace"", that\'s how I kind of want the direction of this manga to follow. Well, not exactly as the latter, but I expect for there to be more instances and situation where her skills as a doctor/pharmacist and knowledge of medicine are tested and thus, growth as a character and social status. Seeing how this is a seinen manga, I hope that the author would go in-depth as it is such a waste to just focus the story on the romance and shallow introduction of her medicine knowledge.\n\r\nWith that being said, if you\'re here because you seen this manga popping up  in your recommendations or anywhere, go ahead and give it a shot!

NISIOISIN justifies the existence of this season exceedingly well by fleshing out the other aspects of Monogatari he hasn't touched upon, such as the lore and certain characters that may have been left hanging. Every arc, bar one, is either stupidly fun or just plain beautiful to read. Nadeko and Sodachi easily become some of the best characters in this series since this season finally gives them the much deserved resolutions to their character arcs.\n\r\nIt might be no masterpiece, but my inner Monogatari fanboy has nothing to give but a 10.

It's a book taking place years after the present day, answering the question of what happened to the gang after the events of Final Season. At face value it's just a book made by NISIOISIN to milk the series further, but once you reach the third arc it gets really interesting, to put it without spoilers.

The history is the same as any other spokon... or at least this is what you will expect when you start reading it, but one of the characters will make a diference about it and then the history will take an dark background. Afterall it's another spokon story si will not make the diference, but is not that bad by the way.\n\r\nArt: 8\r\nNothing that makes the diference... So why did you put an 8? Well, you just have to read it and then you will see why, the autor transmits all the feeling in the careers and are actually (even nowing who will won or lose the caree) excting as fuck. Probably it's not the best artwork you will see on a manhwa because the background stage of some pages are not the best, but you'll definetly like how is made the artwork in general.\n\r\nCharacter: 9\r\nThis is strange and a little bit bizard but let's start, first of all i have to say that the characters design and personality are so poor... but then Vinny makes his appear and becomes an special character that you will probably never forget.\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\r\nCiclism is actually one of my favourite sports like basketball so I really enjoy it as fuck. If you like spokons suchs as Haikyuu!, Kuroko no basuke or Yowamushi Pedal, you will probably, love as much as i love Wind Breaker.\n\r\nOverall: 9\r\nI think it will never deserve a 10 but considering how the history is going and how is improving the autor with the time i really want to support it and read one chapter every week, enjoying every single line and every single drawing of it.\n\r\nI know this is short, i know this is porbably a bad review, but i am just impresed about this manhwa, so i actually just realised that i can coment here to recomendate to anyone because, and afterall, Wind Breaker it's actually a GOOD manwha.\n\r\nThanks.""]"

In fact the stylistic choices throughout the saga continue to get more and more inspired in their lunacy, it really is a joy to read and appreciate the unique art on display.\n\r\nJosuke is surrounded by a motley crew of friends, family, enemies, enemies turned friends, friends turned enemies, random ghosts, aliens, and animals with attitude.  They all fit one genre trope or another, but they're all very entertaining and very distinct.\n\r\nPart 4 has awesome battles and abilities as usual for the franchise, and is almost worth it just for an action scene towards the latter half involving a motorcycle, a baby carriage and an unstoppable 'stand'.  Araki's battles rarely ever rely on what today's staple shonen bestsellers always use: the old 'allies appear from nowhere and save the day' routine.  Araki's characters get pushed and pushed into tight corners and work their way out using brain power, or if their allies do appear, it’s because of planned out teamwork, not mere coincidence or luck.\n\r\nAnd even though there are a lot of 'standalone' stories in part 4 as opposed to a big mission, they're for the most part well thought-out and have plenty of great payoffs.  They all thankfully advance the plot or character relations in some manner too, which is essential for good storytelling using a standalone format.\n\r\nEspecially the last story arc of Part 4 which is excellent indeed, with our plucky good guys facing-off against the saga's best villain.  Yes better than Dio and his generic world-domination plans, Part 4's villain's threat is much more terrifying for its relation to reality.  It’s easier to be threatened by a sociopath who avoids fights and attention (knowing full well he can silence anyone he pleases easily) and preys on the weak for his own satisfaction.\n\r\nDespite its flaws and rocky beginning, part 4 sustains JoJo's tendency for making readers laugh out loud at the surreal humour and quickly turn pages in anticipation of the next outstanding battle and all the twists and turns it entails.  Even Joseph's playa ways, which I cited as an unnecessary misstep, gets a humorous payoff at the end.\n\r\nI can barely think of anything negative to say about this manga after all.  JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is probably the greatest shonen ever, its amazingly long publishing run and popularity proves it.""]"
108,['Pandora Hearts'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/3031/Pandora_Hearts,"[""I never expected to like Pandora Hearts. I hate the Victorian era, get easily bored by mysteries, and am typically annoyed by fluffy cuteness. I much prefer violence, blood, and deep, dark storylines. And yet, I love Pandora Hearts to pieces!! I think I experience it from a different angle than many other PH fans, so I want to offer my perspective.\n\r\nI love all the characters here. Really, I've never loved so many characters so much before. They all have very colorful personalities, representing most of the standard animanga archetypes but elaborating on each in unique ways. I connect with all of them very strongly.\n                  ...\nThere's lots of great chemistry between the characters, ranging from laugh-out-loud funny to depressingly-dark. I love the full spectrum of emotion here. But characters alone do not a good series make.\n\r\nThe plot is incredible. It is complex, but not to the point of confusion. The whole thing so far is about unraveling what happened during a tragedy 100 years ago in order to prevent it from happening again. As such, most of the plot takes place in the past, and is revealed through pieces of characters' memories. Herein lies my favorite philosophical obsession with this series. I love how PH addresses the fact that partial memory is a very dangerous thing. The characters get their memories back gradually, and in very fragmented form. They don't know the whole story, and their assumptions about what happened and about who they are given the limited information they have affects self-image, personality, and actions, even if the assumption they made isn't true.\n\r\nHow do people deal with the idea that there's more to them than the life they know, or that they're essentially more than one person? What if everybody around them expects them to be somebody else? How does this shape their perception of identity? What if you don't remember enough? What if you forgot that you wanted to forget? And what do you do when you remember too much? Or what if the past that made you who you are completely changed? These are the kinds of questions addressed in Pandora Hearts.\n\r\nThere is much re-read value in this series. Many things happen before they are explained, or before a character remembers its significance, so you pick up on a lot of things you missed on your 2nd (or 3rd or 10th) read through.""]"

So, let me count thee ways of awesome-ness.\n\r\nBeing a fan of both anime and manga (though anime has only a few episodes in as well) I couldn’t pass the opportunity to rant about it.\n\r\nThe story\'s main theme are on the simplicity of friendship, passion, and dreams, some the things that matter and drive our spirit as a youngster (first time ever to use that word). Not any\n                  ...\npassion, a form of passion that moves us and sometimes helps us achieve things we didn’t think we could, even if we feel that part of us has long ago deserted us.\n\r\nChihaya is an outspoken girl who looks up to her model sister and is her number one fan. Her number one dream is for her sister to become a great model.\r\nOne day, Arata  transfers into her class and automatically because of his shy and none talkative nature he is secluded and picked on., His number one bully is Taichi, Chihaya’s friend since childhood. Through a few random occurrences they end up becoming friends. Arata then introduces her to the world of karuta, a card (sorta) game.  Her world is never the same after that.\n\r\nChihaya’s point of view is pure, the only type of innocence that a kid can accomplish. The beginning is mainly showing us how karuta entered her life and how it changed her.\r\nRight a way you can tell things are going to happen that are going to test the boundaries of friendship, will, love, and everything in between.  Not necessarily romantic love, I mean the love you have for your dreams, goals, and for your friends. How people growing apart and having their own life doesn\'t mean they forget you . How no matter what the distance, they don\'t always really lose that part of themselves that made you friends to begin with.\n\n\r\nThe art is clean and beautiful. I loved to see the transformation into their  older self and that they looked different and yet you can tell it’s them and not because they still resemble their old self somehow. It’s very well done. But hands down the anime gives you the full effect of said art. You’ll know what I mean when you see it. Still very cute and charming, just like the story thus far.\n\r\nThe characters are one of the best thing in this manga, though what gives it a nice touch is the karuta element.\r\nArata , Taichi, and Chihaya are great characters, whose individual persona are what make them a great combination, because they are very different. Chihaya grew up and didn’t forget and throughout the beginning you can tell that she’s the glue, the proverbial glue that holds them together at the end. Her and karuta. It always goes back to that game to the point that it’s character of its own.\n\r\nI didn\'t really find anything I disliked with the manga. It\'s too early to tell what direction it\'s actually going to go, although we can speculate at this point but I really hope I\'m wrong (I like to be surprised!). It has a shoujo atmosphere about it that is a common ground with a lot of manga but it also feels like it\'ll have more depth just like the first few chapters suggest.\n\r\nThe end of each chapter is a constant reminder that you shouldn’t give up on your dreams. No matter how young or old or in between, dreams are dreams. They fuel us to keep going, to look forward.\r\nThe thing to see is if Chihaya, Taichi and Arata can sustain the flow of time and distance…\r\nI can’t say anything else since there are too few chapters out as of now. But it\'s definitely worth a shot.\n\r\n“You can’t call it a dream if you don’t work on it yourself.”']"
110,['Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/22/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan,"['As we move closer and closer to the next decade, it seems like we keep on getting farther and farther away from amazing samurai stories.  With possibly the recent exemption of Samurai Champloo and Gintama (which, to be fair, aren\'t your typical Meiji era samurai story, there seems like an apparent lack of new series that features your traditional Japanese samurai.  Well, new series that are actually entertaining and interesting to read.  The mid-90\'s and the turn of the century saw the unveiling of many great series (most still ongoing) like Vagabond and Blade of the Immortal, which truly define and really\n                  ...\nsets the standards of your traditional samurai story, though not your typical mainstream stuff.  That is where Rurouni Kenshin comes into play.  Nobuhiro Watsuki has really defined the standard of this genre, since his story was arguably the most mainstream and popular of the three.  With the anime receiving mixed reviews because of the mistreatment of its final season (which were all fillers), its important to go back to the original manga counterpart and review what exactly sets apart Rurouni Kenshin from other manga and anime, and really, why when people hear the name of this series, have the tendency to group it with the elite of japanese work.\n\r\nWe begin with the story.  Himura Kenshin, whose character is loosely based off a real life samurai during the Japanese Revolution back in the mid-1800\'s, is known as the dreaded Hitokiri Battousai and for some reason, he left the revolution halfway with a cross-shaped scar on his left cheek, a reverse-blade sword and a vow never to kill again.  Simply with this much information that is revealed at the beginning of the story, we get a sense that Kenshin\'s past must have been full of strife, hardship and events which turned him away from the life of a hitokiri to that of a wanderer (rurouni).  And simply put, that is where the broad story feeds off of.  As you begin to read the manga, you are unfolded to events which will reveal his past to you, all the way up to the final chapter.  Not only does this keep everything interesting, but it really gives you a chance to dive into the mind of Himura Kenshin and actually feel what he has felt, see what he has seen, and literally, witness Kenshin\'s developing character from start to finish.  Watsuki has almost flawlessly done this as advertised, with three main arcs to his story - the Tokyo arc, the Kyoto arc and the Jinchuu (Revenge) arc - the latter two really the main players in defining this series.\n\r\nAnother feature that gets easily overlooked in Watsuki\'s legendary story is the art.  I feel when people look at manga as a whole, they look at all the obvious elements of plot, character, etc., but a major categoy that is a factor in the enjoyment score is how well has the series been drawn.  Is it consistent?  How detailed?  And most importantly, do I actually know what the hell is going on, especially during battles?  Each of these questions are answered positively in the art as the character models and designs do stay consistent with the mid-1800 feel and culture.  The environments, though not intricately as designed as other series, do hold up in its own right, but prevent that ""outsanding"" score.  And the nice part with Rurouni Kenshin is that Watsuki has done a decent good job in drawing the flow of battles to the point where you\'re not questioning yourself what just happened.  Although, some of the sword techniques some characters have will make you stare at the page and be like, ""is that even physically possible?""\n\r\nThe character development of Himura Kenshin really comes alive through his dialogue and interactions with the other characters.  Well, one might think, ""of course this would be the case,"" but the fact of the matter is that most of the characters that you witness this kind of relationship all have some vendetta or hatred against the Battousai, which makes it all the more interesting to see how Kenshin goes about putting to rest not only these characters, but also his inner hitokiri self.  And for as much as these characters bring out the worst in him, it is evenly balanced with his daily, ever growing relationship with Kaoru Kamiya.  These interesting character relations and interactions are augmented prodigiously during the Kyoto and Jinchuu arcs, where you get to see the other, more deadly, side of Kenshin for the first time.  I will say that some of the characters will make you question what exactly was the manga-ka thinking when he created them, but after watching them in battle, it\'ll be a simply afterthought.\n\r\nWitnessing Kenshin go through all these ordeals is what really makes the manga so interesting.  With his belief and vow of never to kill again, you really wonder sometimes if he is able to keep it, as there are many circumstances which really push Kenshin\'s psyche to the limit and even at times, his hitokiri side is unveiled.  This is really, in my eyes, what makes the story so enjoyable to read.  Every avenue of Kenshin\'s past, present and future is explored in heavy detail, leaving you with a fulfilled story, an actual complete ending and a truly satisfied feeling of nirvana (okay, maybe I\'m stretching it a little bit), but you get the point.  To say the least, the story is captivating, especially if japanese samurai, traditional sword-style battles that don\'t drag on, are things you are looking for in a manga.']"
111,['Skip Beat!'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/610/Skip_Beat,"['When I first heard about Skip Beat, I (sadly) wasn\'t one of the first people who loved it from its summary. In fact, after reading the brief summary I went ""Psshhh, what\'s so great about this? No originality at all! The art isn\'t even that great either!"" and walked away. \r\nThe reason I first started to read it was because \r\n1) I had finished my favorite manga at the time\r\n2) I was extremely bored and it was ranked quite high\r\nHorrible reasons I know, and I really didn\'t think I would enjoy Skip Beat at all. In fact I don\'t know why there were so many\n                  ...\npeople that love this series. \n\r\nAfter the first chapter, I was hooked. The main girl at first was just like any other but the comedy and sarcasm and carefully drawn out eyes got my attention. Plus, the originally ""not so original"" plot began to seem much more interesting. After that, I read every single chapter up to 139 in about 3 days.\n\r\nStory: It\'s not that high on the originality style because I can probably name a couple of stories that revolve around revenge and etc. However, the plot after the beginning, although a bit cliche, is still quite different and makes you crave more. That\'s the important thing, sure plot is necessary but even if the plot isn\'t ""original"" so long as the characters are good, then the story will automatically be good. Which is why this is 9.\n\r\nArt: Okay, so the bodies are a bit exaggerated and elongated to show how ""beautiful"" they really are. Even though this a bit of a turnoff for me at first before I read the manga, I grew to be able to ignore the bodies and focus more on the facial expressions and eyes. Her eyes are amazing, it shows you all of the emotions and feelings. Since you can grow to ignore or later like me now, enjoy the exaggeration then art goes to 10. If you can\'t, it\'s more 9 since you cannot deny that most shoujo manga art is quite beautiful.\n\r\nCharacter: No matter what anyone says, characters are JUST AS or even MORE important than the plot. No matter how unique or original your plot is, if your characters don\'t match up to it, the book or manga is not going to fare well. What Skip Beat lacks in it\'s originality department, it shows up in the characters. I won\'t go into great detail at the people because it would border on spoilers but as you read you can greatly identify each of the character\'s inner thoughts. Since this is told in Kyoko\'s perspective, you get to see how crazy she gets and laugh your head off at her ""misfortune""! Truly an interesting main character.\n\r\nEnjoyment: It\'s great. That\'s all I can really say. You laugh, you sympathize, you cry and you get angry along with Kyoko. It\'s amazing when a manga can get you going that much. This manga really is great and I\'m sure even the worst critics (like me) can enjoy this.\n\r\nOverall: 10. Simply (almost) perfect. A great read! \n\r\n(Man that really was long! But I hoped this helped at least someone!)']"
112,['One Outs'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/11327/One_Outs,"['“What does it mean to be a winner, the last one standing? It means to climb over a mountain of corpses to get to the top. By no means is it a glorious sight to behold, and in fact, it is extremely cruel. Even so, if you still wish to seek victory... then you must become a devil.”\n\r\nTokuchi Toua’s words reverberate through Kojima Hiromichi’s mind as he steps up in the decisive showdown against their biggest opponents, the all-star Chiba Mariners team. Kojima is the cleanup batter of the struggling baseball team, Saikyou Saitama Lycaons. Even though he is regarded as a local hero, he\n                  ...\nhas never won the championship. At the age of 43, this season might be his very last chance. It has only been a year since he first encountered this extraordinary young man in an underground baseball gamble called “One Outs”. After convincing him to join Lycaons, Tokuchi has slowly and miraculously transformed one of the weakest team around into a title contender. Will Kojima finally be able to fulfill his lifelong wish and lead his team to glory?\n\r\nOne Outs is not your typical sports manga. Created by Kaitani Shinobu (author of Liar Game), One Outs doesn’t gloss itself with pompous values such as teamwork, sportsmanship, hard work, determination or friendship. Tossing all naivety aside, it portrays the baseball game as a place where the victor walks over the fallen and the winner takes all. To win, you must deceive, cheat, and manipulate your adversaries, even your very own team mates. What makes One Outs truly unique is that it is all about trickery and mind games… in baseball.\n\r\nThe centerpiece of this manga is undoubtedly Tokuchi Toua. He is probably one of the slickest and most badass characters in town. He is a 134-kmph pitcher who can only throw straight balls. Laughable in professional baseball’s standard. However, Tokuchi is the ultimate trickster. Behind his arrogant and nonchalant demeanor, lies the ability to read everyone like a book. He deceives and manipulates everyone to dance around at his whim. Once Tokuchi catches hold of his opponent’s weaknesses, he will exploit them ruthlessly and utterly destroy the very core of their spirit, all the while mocking at their foolishness. Whatever you throw at him, be it true skill, cheating or foul play, he will always be able to counter it with an ingenious strategy. All is fair game and only the winner defines what justice is. \n\r\nThe other characters are pretty much forgettable and have little role to play. Seriously. One Outs is a one-man showpiece, letting you gush at the awesomeness of the protagonist. But that isn’t necessarily such a bad thing. Once you get into the story, Tokuchi works his charm and keeps you guessing his next move. The biggest disappointment is probably Kojima, since he is supposedly the heart and soul of the Lycaons team. Excusing the injury he suffered at the start of the story, he hardly makes any impact on the outcome of the matches.\n\r\nThe story itself is full of intrigue. The One Outs contract that Tokuchi signed with Lycaons sets the stage for the high stakes gamble between him and the owner. The owner, being the despicable money-grubbing bad guy, will resort to any means possible to destroy Tokuchi and win the bet. Throughout the Lycaon’s quest for the championship, Tokuchi is pitted against all kinds of opponents: from the fastest base runner, a genius batter with unrivalled in-motion vision, a master tactician, an expert cheating team and even sabotage by his own team mates. This is where the story draws you in. Cliffhangers and suspense are aplenty. You know Tokuchi is gonna kick everyone’s butt but you just have no idea how. And he’s never going to reveal it until the very end. The strategies and schemes used are brilliant, and the execution by Tokuchi is near flawless. Be it the weather, the pitch, the people, or the game rules. He will find a way to bend them to his advantage.\n\r\nSome people who watched the anime might complain that the story only revolves around the One Outs contract, making the matches pointless. However, Tokuchi has planned far ahead and everything he does has a far-reaching influence. The anime only covers the first half of the manga. Without spoiling too much, I can tell you that the third quarter is about a revised One Outs contract and the rest deviates from the contract completely. There is much more character development at the later stages, when Tokuchi tries to change the loser mentality of the Lycaons team and improve the team in his own unique way.\n\r\nI do find the final stages of the story slightly lackluster. Even though it is nice to see another side of Tokuchi, trying to honor his promise with Kojima, it fails to build up the tension and reach a really climatic ending. I suppose it’s the result of the epic battles that were crafted out earlier, that the final showdown pales in comparison. In my opinion, this is what keeps One Outs from being a true masterpiece.\n\r\nThe artwork is nothing spectacular, but does its job and is fairly decent. I especially like how the mangaka draws the expressions of the characters. The drawing is believable and makes the comedic moments hit the mark perfectly when they occur, albeit occasionally. I have no complaints.\n\r\nOne Outs is a really fun read, especially if you like baseball and something intelligent. I never watch baseball games and barely know any rules. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it immensely. I don’t think I need to remind you again but Tokuchi really kicks ass!\n\r\n“Nobody wins, but I!”']"

Want to enjoy eye pleasing art you can stare at all day? Want to see a good mix of character development and relatability? Want to enjoy every frame and panel in this manga? Well, if so, I recommend taking a peek at this manga because personally, all of this criteria has fulfilled me. \n\r\nSTORY: 10\r\nTo me, this story is original in my opinion. Although the idea of having a supernatural partner is an old concept, the way the author molds that cliche into her own special thing in a school setting with little adventures involving supernatural school\n                  ...\nrumors, is astounding. She takes the story of what many might know as Bloody Mary and turns it into a whole school-wide adventure that I know I've had imaginations of as a child but I have never seen anybody build it into a compelling story. I don't know about you, but I felt loads of different emotions while reading this and I hope you do too.\n\n\r\nART: 10\r\nThe art is a cutesy loli kind of style that I usually do not like in my manga. But, this is an exception. It absolutely captures the innocence of the characters yet it also turns the cute to creepy when needed. The landscape and all of the scenery are crisp and vivid even though it is just black and white. You guys should experience the art yourselves, since everybody's tastes are different, but make sure to try it out!\n\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10\r\nThe characters are honestly SO ADORABLEEEEEEEEE. I feel like I can hug each lil character in my arms although not all are portrayed as the protagonists. Thinking back now, some may see the character types as cliche with their personalities in the sense of maybe this dude is like the cool popular type or that girl is too clumsy, but the author really did not make me sense that while reading at all. Character tropes are being reused and recycled all the time now, and so far, to me, this manga utilizes the tropes to fit when needed, and there is great character development that I feel like I'm receiving an achievement while reading ^^ \n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\r\nOverall enjoyment? AMAZING! I literally did not do anything but read it the whole day (it was winter break D:: no judge plzz ;-;) because the story was so entertaining to read.

117,['Medalist'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/129621/Medalist,"[""Hi, I'm a figure skater.\n\r\nThis manga is incredible and I can attest to that. (TL;DR at bottom)\n\r\nSTORY: 9\n\r\nIt's a simple premise, a journey of Inori's way to an Olympic medal, but that's what makes the story so great. With such a simple plot, there's no limit to what you can do with it if you know and care for the sport. (Which, the author absolutely does, considering nearly everything to do with actual figure skating is factual.) For example, they incorporate actual skating culture into the manga, which unfortunately is a culture of classism and superiority complexes, but the culture also attributes to the plot\n                  ...\nas well, oftentimes becoming a wall for Inori to climb over. A story about a bullied kid aiming to be the best is nothing new, but nobody has ever done it like the author of Medalist has.\n\r\nThe story is Medalist's strongest point, in my opinion, with how well done and versatile it is.\n\r\nART: 8\n\r\nNow, the art is absolutely something unique, but specifically, the paneling is what I enjoy most. In figure skating competition, you have the whole rink to yourself, and it seems like the author is trying to replicate that feeling of freedom with their use of panels. Characters often break the boxes, sometimes there are no boxes, there's so much dynamic movement that multiple panels are used to not only emphasize the highlight of a trick, but also to show every part of a given trick; it's creative and fun for skaters and non-skaters alike. To me, seeing this paneling felt like standing in an open rink by myself, and I can only hope everyone else gets that same feeling, because I loved it.\n\r\nThe author's expressions are... well, expressive! Extremely so! But it's not a bad thing at all! Sure, the lines can sometimes get scratchy and a little hard to make out in a few cases, but their use of scratchy lines really makes for fun art to look at! The character expressions themselves make me laugh because they're so exaggerated and funny looking. It's amazing how the author can switch between drawing a realistically accurate skate, to adorable characters, to those same adorable characters bawling their eyes out obnoxiously because they're kids. So great!\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\n\r\nOh my god, I honestly don't know where to start. It's amazing.\n\r\nInori is your typical lovable underdog, and (in the 6 chapters I've read) she has so much room for development and has even already had some. Her development isn't even cliché, it's actually seeming to be very original and something known only to Inori. She's fun and hilarious with her interactions with everybody, her dedication and drive to skate is so carefully crafted, and her other traits are unique and make her character to be easy loved.\n\r\nI mentioned clichés before, and, yes, some of the characters do fall into clichés. But, they're not limited to only the cookie cutter mold they were (Or weren't, I don't know the author's characterization process.) molded by, they have good development and reason for falling into a cliché, it's never for no reason.\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\n\r\nMy favorite part of the review, all the personal sappy bits!\n\r\nReading this manga was so much fun, like recognizing technique practice and tricks and *coughs* falling on your ass a lot. But I especially loved seeing the passion the characters had and the passion the author must have in order to put that into them. It's not easy to write a story from the beginning of a sports career, there's so much that goes on under the surface of what regular sports enjoyers see, but this author clearly did their research and made sure that the whole process of figure skating, from getting a coach, to competing for the first time, was as accurate as can be.\n\r\nOf the sports series I've seen, there isn't much figure skating representation. Yuri on Ice!!! exists and I love it, but that's about it, and it's a sports-romance anime as well. Nothing that's purely figure skating, which is odd considering how popular a sport it is.\n\r\nI adore Medalist because it's figure skating for figure skating's sake. A child with a passion who chases that for as long as they can, and isn't that what every successful figure skater stared out as? That's what I started out as, and seeing myself in these characters was something I've never felt before. (In the lens of a skater, at least.) Medalist, despite only having read 6 chapters, means a lot to me, personally.\n\r\nBut for the non-skaters, I know that they can love and appreciate this manga as much as I do too. It's given so much care and attention to detail that, you don't have to be a skater to read it. There are explanations for complicated things, enjoyable moments outside of the skating and amazing art as well. It's an experience for everyone.\n\r\nTL;DR\n\r\nThe story is amazing because the author takes advantage of the freedom they've given themselves by having a simple plot.\n\r\nThe art is unique and extremely fun to look at in every way.\n\r\nThe characterization breaks expectations and gives a reason to appreciate almost all the characters.\n\r\nMy enjoyment is very biased because of my history, but this manga is very easily enjoyed by others who don't share that history.\n\r\nThanks for reading if you did! I really hope this is all concise and easy to understand, but I just had so much to say about Medalist T—T""]"

The manga author recently just overcame cancer during the pandemic. Keigo\'s experience in the hospital at the time was described as boring and uneventful. Keigo missed being able to just ""live"" his life outside. After overcoming his battle, Keigo was inspired to write Hirayasumi on his way home from the hospital by simply looking outside his window in his parents\' car. A central theme of Hirayasumi is enjoying the present or basking in the moment. That moment isn\'t necessarily epic or grand in scale, but just like us, the moments he\n                  ...\nillustrates the most are the moments we wouldn\'t think twice about (having a nice walk, enjoying the scenery around yourself, enjoying the fresh air, etc.). Moments where you look around and say I am glad I am here right now in this moment. Those moments were gone for Keigo when he was hospitalized, and now realizing how beautiful these moments are and how he took those moments for granted he writes and draws Hirayasumi.\n\r\nNow onto the Manga. There is something about Hirayasumi just makes me feel at ease. The art style is so simple yet pretty. The characters feel relatable and realistic. The story isn\'t too complex nor does it have unnecessary drama. Hirayasumi perfectly encapsulates the feeling of slice of life. Hirayasumi carries this vibe that makes reading each chapter more and more enjoyable than the last. \n\r\nHirayasumi is so far very wholesome and just relaxing to read after a long day of work. It makes me thankful that I am still alive, still able to exist in this planet with others and it reminds me to enjoy the present while it lasts.

By Ryohgo Narita.”\n\r\nThe story, ah yes the story; is there even a beginning or a focal point to begin this tale? Perhaps it’s best to look back, the year is 1711 when a group of alchemists together aboard the Advenna Avis summon a demon to grant them the secrets of immortality; little did they know a tragic scene\n                  ...\nwas about to befall the lot gathered. Or maybe you’d like to discuss 1931’s transcontinental Flying Pussyfoot massacre which entailed murder, carnage, and bloodshed between several groups; each out for their own interests all the while hoping to never meet the mysterious monster who lurks about “The Railtracer”. No? Then perhaps you’d like to hear about what happened back in 1930, in which through a set of meticulous coincidences various characters became immortal due to a mere tasting of a particular elixir.\n\r\nBut no! Let’s not forget the characters, yes the characters; they are all incredible important. Why don’t we follow the young gangster with a heart of gold named Firo Prochainezo of the respected Martillo family, who happens to get caught in the business of immortals placing his life in danger during a time when the “Prohibition era” in New York was more than a simply label which defined a time period. Maybe we can follow a more joyous pair of characters, constantly spreading love and happiness wherever they go; an eccentric pair of robbers who call themselves Isaac & Miria. No, who I’d like to follow is in fact the brilliant young capo of the Gandor family, Luck Gandor. Behind him is a young girl named Eve Genoard, in front of him; a mob leader riddled with bullet holes aiming to take his life at any cost.\n\r\nNo matter where you place your focus whether it be on any specific time period or any number of particular characters. You’re sure to be bewildered by the utter brilliance and suspense read throughout these absolutely magnificent set of novels. Ryohgo Narita composes something special with each novel written. Character dialog, action handled throughout each scene, wording used to allow the reader a chance to seep into what’s happening and completely envision what’s being read, narrative composition that further enhances the detailed accounts of each scene. You find yourself quickly being absorbed into the wonders of the Baccano universe; where ever character holds a genuine place in your heart and you wait with baited breathe for a new novel to thus complete your character fandom.\n\r\nThis is Baccano!, brilliant commotion between amazingly portrayed characters. Where a series of unrelated plots and actions cross and intersect thus spiraling out of control. Journey through the early 1700’s where alchemists like Maiza Avaro, Huey Laforet, Elmer C. Albatross, Sylvie Lumiere, Czesław Meyer, and Szilard Quates are desperately seeking immortality and a way to cross the Atlantic to America in hope of a bright new future. All the way up to the 1930’s prohibition period and beyond; where groups of mobsters, thieves, assassins, and everyone’s in between clash violently. Wonderful characters like Firo Prochainezo, Luck Gandor, Isaac Dian, Miria Harvent, Ladd Russo, Jacuzzi Splot, Claire Stanfield, Ennis the homunculus, Adele, Roy, Edith, Tick Jefferson, Maria Barcelito the Mexican assassin, Shouldered Christopher, and Graham Specter all play pivotal roles and waste not one line of each novel.\n\r\nWelcome to Baccano!, wonderfully written novels that hold a genuine place in my heart.']"

Simplicity, however, doesn't mean bad. Although he can come across as being naive for how optimistic he is, it's that same quality that I think a lot of people can sympathize with. People probably wouldn't know the magic of jazz and the point of playing saxophone for hours in the snow, but people will understand his drive and his love for the art. \n\r\nIf I have to be honest, throwing away the topic of jazz, this manga is not really special. The art is above average, the character designs are non-inspiring, and the story is just a cliche came-of-age tale.

My name is Hajime Isayama and today I\'ll teach you how to write manga.\n\r\nI must begin by saying that you should not be discouraged. At first glance, it can be difficult, but you only have to write 90 chapters perfectly tied together, with great characters and mystery to the world and titans, fantastic fights that actually serve a purpose with barely any talk no jutsu moments, and perhaps the single most important thing in all of this, Sasha being alive.\n\r\nWhat you ought to do afterward is write a timeskip. This is meant for the end-series so we can\n                  ...\nhave a ""where are they now"" segment but there is no need to worry about it because another timeskip will occur in the last chapter as we would have the pleasure of seeing in efficiency how terrible Eren\'s plan was. The first timeskip is primarily meant as a means of showing Eren becoming this evil incarnate that at no point in the series have we gotten hits about such alteration to his character. The second one is instead a quick reminder of how Yams got worse at writing a proper story without contrivance to its characters. Both are meant for Eren as he\'s convinced that all lives must be taken in order to obtain ""freedom"" and in doing so he ought to go against his friends causing an artificial conflict between him and the rest of Paradis as well countless third parties in which for entirely redundant reasons will join Paradis side and go against Eren. From this point onwards, you don\'t have to write anything decent since it will all depend on which character is to your liking the most and you\'ll always have to make him or her achieve whatever goal they are in need of. In this case, it\'s Armin. He\'s mastered the talk no Jutsu, I dare to say it\'s his strongest technique. Anyone he\'s talked to has been convinced to help him do whatever he\'s wanted to and its limits know no bounds.\n\r\nWith the power of friendship, Armin doesn\'t give up, not for one moment while he and co-venture towards Eren to stop him but first, we must go a bit before all that because you are clearly asking how all those characters have joined the Paradis side. Because of plot device, they ultimately were there because Eren too changed sides and there was no choice but to help their enemies. The two couldn\'t stay on one side only since that wouldn\'t make sense, just like it doesn\'t make any sense for Reiner, Pieck, and others to help Armin and Mikasa, meant solely as an excuse for ""redemption"" for some of the characters. Armin succeeds because of course, he did, Eren becomes dove because of course, he did, we never learn much about the titans and the few things we get to throw at us are pure nonsense in an asspull way upon the ""paths"" was introduced into the story which, for all intents and purposes is the main reason why the second arc of the timeskip is this bad. Historia getting sidelined from the story by getting pregnant off of some random farmer we never know anything about, which it\'s not the fact the child is not Eren\'s that pissed me off, but rather that she could\'ve done so much that being someone\'s whore. To top it all, Eren Lelouch\'d his ass out of and acts like he did something important or useful when all he did was fight for something he himself committed. I always knew he was going to do that the moment he becomes evil for the greater good but never wanted to believe it as I knew it wouldn\'t work with the story itself.\n\r\nAll the troubles Eren went through, all the people he killed, were just for his friends to live happily ever after. Instead of removing the titan course and finishing what he initially wanted to, he follows the most bullshit route and makes peace for a few generations... slightly for his friends to live their miserable life in complete serenity and with this in mind, the descendants to be inevitably killed. There is no point in taking so many lives when everything remains the same and what Eren has fought so far becomes useless because his goal was suddenly retconned when he confessed his ""love"" to Mikasa all of a sudden. Especially when you murdered 80% of the population and would\'ve taken a mere couple of hours to exterminate the rest and finally be free of the burden. Even if Eren had somehow died because of that, it\'s still a better outcome of what we\'ve got although it needs to once again be mentioned that what led to that would\'ve been abominable regardless. It can\'t get out of character than this, and it makes no sense either given how Mikasa got to suck Horse\'s dick anyway. I wonder what Dove-Eren must\'ve felt when he saw Mikasa getting fucked by the only person he didn\'t want to fuck her. I bet it\'s not sitting well with him.\n\r\n""Thank you Eren for turning yourself into a mass-murder for our sake""\n\r\nIf you want more proof that Armin is the most hateful character, here you go. Eren is the worst character, but Armin is someone you would hate the moment he opens his mouth. When Armin mastered the talk-no-Jutsu it was as clear as day that he was going to succeed in convincing all of the previous enemies into joining his side to take down Eren, which he does, and that he had a plan into making Eren stop but think about it, why would Eren stop and how would Armin make that happen? Apparently, Armin never thought about the consequences, and the whole reason why he did all that in the first place was that it was against genocide, that there had to be a better option to put an end to this and in the last chapter he goes ""Thank you for killing all them fuckers"". What could have possibly happened between his determination to stop Eren and the last chapter that made him accept Eren\'s behavior and get along with everything he\'s done? Armin who is not only the brain of the trio, but was always been morally right, and looking back at everything he\'s always made the right and acceptable decision to put an end to something but in the last chapter he comes across as disingenuous and a piece of shit with virtually no fucking reason that let him to the settlement.\n\r\nAs for tradition, a good lead female in shonen is hard to come by and Mikasa is no exception. You won\'t certainly hate her as much as Eren and Armin but will sure get on your nerves with her stoic persona throughout. In the early series, she\'s got something to work with and her strength was admirable so for all the good reasons she was reliable in that department. I always liked her early on but looking back it\'s clear Yams either didn\'t care much about her or perhaps wasn\'t able to give her more stuff to do as the story went on, which I find extremely odd given how in the post timeskip she was suddenly given more importance than before but ended up being a leftover until the last two chapters gaining the determination to do the thing she should have done a long time ago. Mikasa is a bit awesome in her own way, but she has no ambitions of any kind and comes across as Eren\'s shadow. It is clear that she has had mental issues since she was a kid from the accident she and Eren had and her affection for Eren is due to this, but Yams does not look into this with the possibility that she may recover one day. Eren seemingly hating her was an excuse to make her grow and act on her own rather than following in his footsteps but she does nothing the entire time besides feeling sad at Eren\'s sentiments towards her because Yams never gave a shit about her.\n\r\nI haven\'t talked about the rest of the characters but really, what there is to talk about? They all suck because the writing sucks and the story shifted from average (Marley) to the worst thing (War for Paradis) in a dozen or so chapters and it destroys everyone\'s solid characterization they once had. The transition from Eren becoming evil and after meeting Ymir was awful and the premise itself was bad, to begin with, because it didn\'t build up to characters that would eventually join the Paradis side to defeat a common enemy. It does this by assuming that everyone is fine in the first place, while that couldn\'t be feasible in any way. Yams wanted to give the characters more depth but clearly couldn\'t work with the way they were presented in the first place and also goes against their characters as previously they wanted to defeat Eren as quickly as possible without taking out everyone and yet waste time for trivial stuff. A ""goal"" of any of the characters who weren\'t on Eren\'s side, vanish because the final moments of the story is them trying to reach and take down Eren and in the midst of all the chaos down there, it\'s impossible to get any devolvement, and they don\'t, so Yams had to put Floch as a mini-boss before the final event as a means of showing the ""cooperation"" of the two sides of which couldn\'t work but the shitty writing proved me otherwise.\n\r\nWhich is better, the journey or the destination? The answer is both. But can everyone get that luxury? Unfortunately not. What one must do to get near to said luxury? Make the journey be worth the destination. If the AoT story had followed this thought of mine, it would\'ve made sense. What was only needed is a linear thread to follow and find its end without splitting into different directions because you wanted to make it a more compelling approach to your story. You could, but why risk it when you had the answer right in the palm of your hand?\n\r\nEren died a virgin. That\'s all you need to know!']"

To fulfill the promise to “kill her”, Battler must understand the truth of the witch’s game. Once again he enters the witch’s game for the fifth time even though the host is absent. Could he arrive at the truth this time and fulfill Beatrice’s promise? What is Beatrice’s fate? Who is the mysterious visitor of Rokkenjima?\n\r\nMain Characters: (9)\n\r\nUshiromiya Natsuhi: \r\nUnlike the previous games, Natsuhi and Krauss got an amount of screen time in EP5. Secrets that they held\n                  ...\nback previously have been revealed, which serves as answers to the question arcs. Natsuhi also gets threatens constantly from “the man from 19 years ago”, a major focus of EP5.\n\r\nUshiromiya Battler: \r\nAs Beatrice is in a vegetable state, Lamdadelta takes her place and hosts the fifth game. Battler does not participate the game directly as he was too late to join. He is not the detective in this game and his chess piece is controlled by Bernkastel. In EP5 there are moments where he presents his ridiculous theories which I find really entertaining. However he has his moments in the meta world, together with Beatrice defending Natsuhi’s honor.\n\r\nFurudo Erika: \r\nErika is a visitor of Rokkenjima who claims herself as a detective. Blessed by miracle, she drifts to the island unwounded after a ship accident. She is actually an added chess piece by Bernkastel which has no effects to the previous games. Though she seems well-mannered and polite in first sight, she is actually very cunning and sometimes breaks down when her reasoning falls apart. She would do anything to support her reasoning and is the perfect rival for Battler.\n\r\nDlanor A Knox: \r\nDlanor who acts as Erika’s sidekick is actually the personification of the Ten Commandments written by Ronald A Knox (As a side note, the name Dlanor is Ronald spelled backwards). These Ten Commandments are rules Ronald created that he believes mystery novels should follow, which makes the mystery fairer to the readers. In Uminko’s world, the author deleted one of the rules and changed the other a bit. Dlanor could wield these commandments as “Red Truths” to support Erika’s reasoning.\n\r\nWhat I like about Umineko is though it introduces new casts from time to time, no matter magical beings or not, they are never meaningless and all have their purpose. In EP5, the members of the Eiserne Jungfrau, Gertrude and Cornelia represent Erika’s “weapons” duct tapes and the paper slips that she uses to seal doors. The character Dlanor is the author’s salute to Ronald, giving him credits for his contribution during the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, which I think is meaningful. The great detective Erika, though having a twisted personality, she is a memorable, charming character, my favorite new character introduced in Chiru.\n\r\nStory: (10)\n\r\nEnd of the Golden Witch has a rather slow start, in the beginning it focuses on Krauss and Natsuhi’s financial crisis and their acknowledgment of Kinzo’s condition. Though it has a slow start, these tips are essential to the story, such as the servants keeping their secrecy of the situation in the previous games. \n\r\nEP5 has a lot of impactful scenes. Without spoiling too much, my favorite scene is where Battler and Beatrice “welcomes” Erika to join the witch’s game, which is really well done and satisfying. I cheered for Battler during that scene!\n\r\nDifferent from the previous games, EP5 is a Formal Mystery rather than debating if the scenario is mystery or fantasy. Under the Knox’s Ten Commandments, secret passages cannot exist; Battler’s widely used theories such as “Trap X” is also denied by the commandments. They serve as additional red truths. \n\r\nInterestingly, these commandments could also be used in the previous games to act as additional tips, which aid the readers that have not arrived at the truth yet. It is sort of the author’s way of saying “All the tips have been given to you, the mystery is now solvable”. \n\r\nWith these commandments Umineko could be looked at in a different angle,by re-reading the previous episodes, readers may discover clues and tips they once missed, which I find amusing.\n\r\nIn EP5, there were some new tips to solving the witch's epitaph. To me it’s of the most difficult mystery to solve in the series.\n\r\nAs always, battles and fighting scenes are done through debates and dialogues, which make Umineko stand out and unique. The debates of Red and Blue Truth is even more intense than actually seeing to two characters fighting each other physically.\n\r\nArt: (8)\n\r\nWhat I like about EP5’s artwork is how the character’s expressions are vivid and lively. This expresses their emotions really well, such as when Natsuhi feels hopeless, when Erika’s jeers at others and when Dlanor switches to execute mode. Also, the background is clear and I never felt confused while reading.\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10)\n\r\nAfter reading EP5, I could see that the author is taking another approach to the story. For the first four episodes, if the truth cannot be arrived under that structure, no matter how many same scenarios are done repetitively, the truth still cannot be seen. That is why the author changed the story’s structure and added the Commandments to assist readers.\n\r\nIn my opinion, EP5 is the most challenging scenario amongst all the episodes (excluding EP4 as there were too few tips and Battler never paid attention to the out of control situation. EP4 could have infinite possibilities). Again, the meaning of truth is discussed, Erika’s truth, Battler’s truth and the REAL truth. Different truths could co-exist in the cat box under Schrödinger’s cat, which is my favorite part of Umineko, you are the one to decide what to believe hence becoming your single truth. \n\r\nAs a side note, for those who are interested in the REAL truth for EP5 could visit my profile page below. I did not discover the truth myself, it is the info I read from EP8 Twilight of the Golden Witch manga which I wish to share. These tips were never included in the Visual Novels and with these tips, the Real truth of EP5 is finally revealed.\n\r\nEP5 is really enjoyable; it has twist and turns of unpredictable events, locked room debates that seem impossible and an unexpected, satisfying ending!\n\r\nOverall: (10)\n\r\nEpisode 5: End of the Golden Witch is a solid addition to the series. While answering some questions from previous games, EP5 provides an amount of new challenges. I feel refreshed from the new story structure the author introduced, while giving out new tips, they are also applicable to the four previous episodes. \n\r\nOverall, End of the Golden Witch has an in depth story that is worth thinking about, charming new additional characters, artwork that illustrates the character’s expressions really well. I highly recommend one to read this after the conclusion of EP4 Alliance of the Golden Witch.""]"
125,['Sakamichi no Apollon'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/28393/Sakamichi_no_Apollon,"['While I write this review, the intro of Moanin\' by Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers is playing inside my head. Not just that, for two weeks, all I could hear was pure and awesome jazz songs. Of course it\'s Sakamichi no Apollon\'s fault.  \n\r\nMusic. Do you know how powerful can it be? C\'mon, I bet music changed your life or your day, at least once. Now, jazz songs. Jazz is contagious, you hear it and starts tapping your fingers, moving your shoulders or doing weird footsteps under the table. It\'s magical! In the end, you\'re smiling and you don\'t even know how that\n                  ...\nhappened. You\'re just smiling, even if you got some problems here and there... And this is what this manga is talking about.\n\r\nIn the late 60s, we got a freshman high school student Kaoru, who not so coincidentally looks like a American jazz pianist, Bill Evans, in the early days. He\'s our  honor student kind of character and just moved to Kyushu to live with relatives. In school, he\'s not the most social guy, but destiny brings two new friends, Sentarou and Ritsuko. Sen introduces him to jazz music and after being told he can\'t play other music style, \'cause he\'s a ""piano-classic-songs boy"", Kaoru accepts the challenge and try to learn how to play jazz, without knowing he\'ll not only change his music style, but change inside, change himself.\n\r\nThe story goes by. New characters appear, revelations, some little plot twists that make you feel a tightness in the heart. It\'s a slice of life, don\'t expect action or explosions, don\'t expect the answer to the Universe. This is simple and pure slice of life. Their lives, their thoughts, their feelings (oh, their feelings!) and their problems. That kind of manga you read and say: ""oh man, I\'m this character"" (hey, Kaoru, I\'m with you!). The characters aren\'t ORIGINAL, you have seen a lot of characters like them, ""big brother mentor"", ""childhood friends"", ""delinquent"", ""cute girl"" and ""megane"". Yes, they aren\'t original, but they\'re UNIQUE. Little details makes you love them... I like how things happen, isn\'t your ""oh, let\'s put 60 chapters and solve things, I don\'t know, in the 59th chapter"". It\'s your ""Oh my, is this really happening? But it\'s only chapter 14... Oh, oh, go for it! But wait, oh my"" (I\'m sorry, that\'s my inner self talking). \n\r\nSo, you ask me: ""Why should I read this manga?"" Because it\'s good. It has quality! Doesn\'t matter if it isn\'t the most original one, it\'s unique. Introduces you to a Japan in the 60s with culture and costumes being corrupted. We got japanese christian, which it\'s the first time I see it in a manga. We got a imaginary triangule and ""love hurts"" from a new perspective, not your shoujo-type ""He hates me, sniff sniff, I want to die"". This is Josei, people are dealing with their problems, they\'re facing past issues, changing little by little. The art is a little retro too and I like the artist style. The music recommendations are the best too! So, please, give it a try. If you don\'t like it, I\'m sorry, but I\'m in love with this story. \n\r\nPut some jazz, read it and travel with the characters to the beginning of japanese summer in 1966. \n\r\n** This isn\'t yaoi or shounen-ai. Bromance? Well, maybe a little, if your idea of ""friendship"" is ""boy huging boy? gay!"", but for me is just friendship, two friends laughing, facing life and being comrades. I watched the anime first and I got to say: the anime exaggerates a little bit if you compare it with the manga. But, well, that always happens!']"

Anyways, I hate sappy, cheesy, overdone romance mangas that have no point whatsoever. I'm sure you do too. This manga isn't like that at all.

The scenery\n                  ...\nis really abstract, like Shaft usually do. The chara-design are just like in the anime, but really well drawn. The alternation between serious and funny faces is well-done. For me it\'s better drawn than Berserk (please don\'t hurt me =)\n\r\nCharacter : 10\n\r\nProbably the best bit of the monogatari series. The relation ship and the talking between the characters is just so damn good. Araragi can be really serious and really hilarious at the same time, he\'s a half vampire. The other girls have awesome (sorry to repeat, but it\'s the best world to describe it) personalities. There\'s a tsundere, two lolis, a class rep, a childhood friend and a tomboy. BUT it\'s not as usual and I must specify this point.\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9.5\n\r\nNothing to tell, but I really did have fun reading Bakemonogatari. If you\'re a shônen type reader, maybe it\'s not your type, but you should definitely have a look at it. For the romance fan, there is a few, but not too much.\n\r\nOverall : 9.75 ~ 10\n\r\nSo I recommend everyone to, AT LEAST, have a look at this masterpiece.

129,['Yagate Kimi ni Naru: Saeki Sayaka ni Tsuite'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/115506/Yagate_Kimi_ni_Naru__Saeki_Sayaka_ni_Tsuite,"['Bloom Into You: Regarding Saeki Sayaka, a spin-off novel from an incredible piece of art like Yagate Kimi ni Naru manga. And for me, it was lived up to it. \n\r\nThis light novel was my first I have ever read. I couldn’t give a try to this format before because I am more a person of manga but since Yagakimi is my favourite series, I had to. And I also love Sayaka, so it was impossible to not give it a try. \n\r\nIt was an incredible reading. \n\r\n[From now on, there will be some SPOILERS from both the manga and this novel while I\'m telling\n                  ...\nmy thoughts. So, the warning is done].\n\r\nThis story was written by Hitoma Iruma, the author of Adachi to Shimamura. Nakatani, as she said in the final of each volume, was very satisfied with the result and I’m agree with her, too. \n\r\nThe novel explores the story of Sayaka from her perspective, that is to say, in first person. Something that it’s hard to do well in a manga, I think.\n\r\nAs we know, Sayaka was three years in love with Touko and she couldn’t “win” her love in return because of Yuu. We also learned from Yuu that she had gotten a girlfriend named Haru (someone who I think is the perfect match for her and I will explain why after talking about the third and last volume). But we didn’t know how was her past in details, although we knew about her Senpai in Junior High. \n\r\nThe first volume tells the living experiences of Sayaka from Elementary School to Junior High. We have the possibility to learn how Sayaka was at that time and how much she has changed through the years due to a lot of events told in the novel. We also learn that these changes were heavily influenced by love. \n\r\nFirst, a girl from her former swimming classes when she was in Elementary School and then a Senpai (Yuzuki) from her chorus club of the Junior High. As we know, this last one was the worst experience for her, as well the first approaching to ""love"" because she was very young to understand what had happened with the girl from the swimming classes. \n\r\nSo, Yuzuki was her first love. A girl who confessed her love to Sayaka in the school\'s courtyard, which became a common place for them to pass the time. Sayaka was not confident at starting a relationship with her but eventually, she falls in love. But there was a problem: Yuzuki had never loved her. She wanted just having an experience of love and Sayaka had the bad luck of being her test subject. Plus, Yuzuki’s behaviour was horrible and she breaks up with her after spending months without willing to see her. To the worst, her excuse was that they were not children anymore and that they don’t need to keep on playing as if they were real girlfriends. These words destroyed Sayaka’s heart, leading to a first love experience as the worst posible. At the end, we learn that she changed school to avoid her in the High School and that was how she met Touko, listening to her in the aperture ceremony.\n\r\nProbably, also influenced by the experience with Yuzuki, Sayaka realized she could only fall in love with women. And in that way, she had a love at first sight with Touko due to her beauty and also, as she mentioned it, her curiosity of how someone got better grades than her.\n\r\nWe have read the manga, so we know about their relationship. The second volume explores all her experiences through High School, even the first year when obviously they hadn’t met Yuu yet. This volume was the “weakest” for me in terms of history and storytelling but that doesn’t mean it was bad. I liked the first more because it tells a new story and I think the personality of Sayaka was portrayed in a very good way. This second just add some things to the three years of Sayaka in High School from her perspective. That is to say, the same timeline of the manga.\n\r\nDuring that time, her intelligence was enough to realize Touko was hiding her real personality, trying to imitate her sister, although she never stopped being in love with her even with that knowledge. But she couldn’t do anything. She couldn’t win over Yuu to unmask the real Touko. So, was Sayaka really happy at the end of the manga with how the things had gone on? \n\r\nWell, as I mentioned earlier, two years after their graduation, Sayaka got a girlfriend in college named Haru. \n\r\nThe third volume, and my favourite of the novel, makes way for a new Sayaka. Her unrequited love with Touko ended in a good way with her because she could fully express her feelings and that didn’t stop them from continue being friends. \n\r\nWe have a college student Sayaka. We learn she has become very good friends with Yuu, what I find beautiful because she could left behind her little jealousy to form a great friendship with someone incredible like Yuu. Plus, they live close to each other, so this helped to reinforce the relationship now that they had both graduated. We have even seen this at the end of the manga, when Yuu talks about Haru and Touko didn’t know anything about her. Sayaka chosed Yuu to be the first to know about her new relationship and even introduced them to each other. \n\r\nHaru Edamoto, new Sayaka’s girlfriend. A very energetic person, as the same Sayaka describes her. She met Sayaka while crying after being dumped by her ex. The fate made that this encounter was the first of much others in the future. And that’s how they formed a very good friendship leading Sayaka to experience new and unknown feelings. She is very serious, thoughtful and cautious as we know, so being friends with someone as energetic and carefree like Haru leads her to be first bewildered but then happy. Because, how can you not fall in love with someone such cheerful and happy like Haru spending the time everyday with her?  \n\r\nBut, Haru was the first in confessing her love. She said it was at first sight. Like the love of Sayaka for Touko, so she understood that feeling putting on the spot of Haru. But she was scared. She immediately remembered her horrible experience with Yuzuki-senpai, due to starting a relationship with someone that she didn’t really love and then ending in the worst way posible. She didn’t want to experience the same thing again. So, she took her time. She thought a lot. She understood her feelings for Haru were different from her Senpai. She understood Haru’s feelings were real, not like Senpai. She understood she was happy spending time with her despite of her carefreeness, something unusual in someone like her. She understood she would fall in love with her even if it not was equal at the moment. Because Haru made Sayaka experience sort of new beautiful things and, of course, this include real love. That\'s why I think Haru is the perfect match for her, even though Sayaka found problematic to face her personality when they first started their friendship but we know how love works. \n\r\nBy the way, these thoughts that Sayaka had to go through are similar to what Yuu had to face to realize she had fell in love with Touko. Iruma captured very well the scence of the manga with this. \n\r\nLastly, what happened to her relationship with Touko? Well, although it was mere coincidence that she found about Haru because of Yuu’s commentary, Sayaka was capable of talking with her about her new relationship months later and in that way, clearing her true feelings. Sayaka understood it could be possibly that they would talk less and less often due to her new lives, but she also understood that Yuu would make her happy. And that was everything she wanted for her. Because she knew that the Touko who was sitting in front of her, was the real Touko and not an imitation of another person as she was in her past. And that, of course, it\'s thanks to Yuu. \n\r\nI am really happy Sayaka could find the love she was looking for, and of course, her real happiness.\n\r\nI highly recommend this to everyone who loves YagaKimi.

Spy X Family; a read entertains its readers not just for the aesthetics, but also for the appeal and really comedic story the manga has to offer.\n\r\nSpy X Family basically has two things: 1) No matter what your job is, raising a kid is still the hardest and 2) Every plan can be executed even without a plan.\n\r\nLogically speaking, the manga has believable scenarios especially portraying how underground work works.

131,['Fruits Basket'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/102/Fruits_Basket,"[""I find that there are people who absolutely love (this seems to be the majority) Furuba or people who can't stand it. \n\r\nI believe that it's hard not to like Furuba. At first I thought it was just going to be funny, because the first 7 or so volumes are full of hilarious scenes (mainly because whenever the Juunishi are hugged by the opposite sex, they change!). But once you get to volume 6 everything seems to start to gravitate in a different direction. \n\r\nThe story line, when it's revealed, is a little cliche in my opinion. Hence the rate of a 9. Don't get\n                  ...\nme wrong, its a beautiful story and one I find myself learning from over and over again no matter how many times I read it. It's about growing up and becoming who you're meant to be and finding the reason why you were born. It's almost hard to believe sometimes, the pain the characters have to go through in Furuba. But I'm so engrossed in each pain that it's not something that can be put down easily. \n\r\nThe characters are the winning point in Furuba. In reality they'd be a bunch of loners, depressing and sad. And just about every one of them is believable. Their personalities range from overtly happy (meaning there hiding the pain) to stubborn as a horse (go figure) and just down right conceited (he knows who he is). Even 'God' too. The growth of each of them is stunning and gorgeous and reading them grow is like watching the sun rise on a rainy day. I've laughed obnoxiously, cried until my chest hurt and felt the red hot burn of hatred while reading this manga. My favorite character is Kyo because he's absolutely adorable and I think I would also try to solve everything with anger myself. And the one character that I hated and grew to love was Yuki because he, in my opinion, is the one who grows the most. The one problem I have though is our main character. I love and I hate Tohru Honda. It's hard to place into words, what Tohru is. Because she becomes everything at once. A mother, a sister, a friend, a confident, a hero and the reason for someone else's life. But she's also the saddest girl I have ever seen. Bottled up with the most horrifying feelings. Even in the beginning it's obvious. Losing your mother would tear anyone's heart it two. I love her and what she does for everyone in the story. Because if I were to meet her myself, I think I would react much as all the Zodiac do. I would treat her as if she were the sun itself. But where, but in a manga, do you find someone so selfless.\n\r\nThe enjoyment I had and continue to have for this manga is absolute. I own every single volume and I'll pick up one all the time and just read it. There's a lesson in every chapter and words, that even though I don't think anyone in the real world has the heart to say, that make me want to become a better person. Someone who would give and give and give and ask for nothing in return. It makes me want to smile. To be the reason that someone else could smile. It makes me want to to the rock that someone can stand on. It's hard to read this manga and not feel ashamed for something you've done. It makes me ashamed to feel that I don't do as Tohru does. Which is why I believe that everyone should read this manga. Because it's heartwarming, sad, and where life continues to grow.""]"
132,['Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/2062/Kara_no_Kyoukai__The_Garden_of_Sinners,"[""Have you ever been so elated about a decision that you made which brought you  an indescribable elation and great fruition to you? \r\nWell, I, for once felt that joy when I opted to read the novel of Kara no Kyoukai (KnK) rather than watching the movie series first. Right after I read the novel, I watched the films (obviously, the animation just blew me away) and then the thought came to me that if I had watched the films first, then I could not have understood almost the entire story behind each and every incident that occurred in that world.\n\r\nStory & Storytelling (9/10):\n                  ...\n\n\r\nTotally, there are 7 different incidents that take place in 7 different timelines. These incidents form the crux of their respective stories and the entire plot revolves around these incidents in some way or the other even if you get the feeling that you are being dragged away from the main part of the story. Before you can even realize, you will be thrown into the story and you'll never see it coming. That's how great the storytelling was when it comes to KnK. The 5th chapter here deserves a special mention for its brilliant story narration and plot even though there will be many terms related to magic persisting in that world that we may not be familiar about.  \n\r\nNote that, the entire series takes place in an anachronical manner; meaning, the timelines are all jumbled up but it is safe to say that reading as it is will help in better understanding of the entire plot rather than opting for a chronological order while reading for the 'first' time. The storytelling is really nice and you will get hooked to the story in no time. The monologues from different characters are one to look out for, there were some thought provoking quotes from the various characters, the interactions between the characters were natural and even when you feel that the story is traversing in a roundabout way rather than plunging straight into the climax, you will end up realizing that it was all a necessity and worth the read. The way in which the story was told more than made up for the lack of art since this is a novel and not a manga. \n\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\n\r\nTo sum it all up in one word, the characterization was just brilliant. All the characters lived up to their roles and fulfilled them thoroughly. The protagonist on the male side is Kokuto Mikiya while the one who helms the role as the female protagonist is the ever-graceful Ryougi Shiki. There cannot be a character in the virtual world that oozes more beauty, grace and serenity than Shiki Ryougi. She basically runs the show in many chapters and just so you know, she is strong. Real strong. Equal importance is given to the people who are behind the incidents, their circumstances being explained thoroughly so as to leave no stone unturned. Like I said before, the monologues and the interactions are to be watched for. \n\r\nThe story revolves around Shiki, Mikiya and Aozaki Touko; the Chief of the place named Garan no Dou where Mikiya works and where Shiki is a regular customer. Touko is mainly present to clarify the doubts put forth by both Mikiya and Shiki (same doubts that arise in our mind while we watch/read KnK) where there is heavy involvement of magus, origin, sorcery and otherworldly beings. But, even she is forced into action in the 5th chapter or the 5th movie. Mikiya, who is peace-loving and a man filled with a sense of justice, is there to protect Shiki even at the cost of his life and is even ready to bear the sins that Shiki has committed. Even though the story is set in a non-chronological order, there are visible traits of character development; especially when it comes to Shiki Ryougi. I am forced to not reveal more about the characters as it might end up spoiling the fun and excitement for you but, that said, an extra amount of attention to the dialogues spoken by those who cause the incidents could be paid so as to have a mental experience of what they are undergoing or have undergone. The movie series makes use of this in the best way possible since it becomes a little difficult to grasp the feelings of the characters while reading a novel. This was how it was for me, at the least.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\n\r\nI would be lying blatantly if I say I didn't enjoy this novel and it would also be an understatement to say that both the KnK novel and the movie series were only 'good'. At times, since it is next to impossible to make the brain function with full concentration, some dialogues were difficult to grasp while even if the concentration was high, you cannot just help but wonder what is happening. A huge amount of never before heard words come in play in the 5th chapter and it just won't be enough if you were to skim/glance through all the dialogues if you are in the plan of reading the novel only once (although, sooner or later you'll pick it up again just for the sake of it). \n\r\nKara no Kyoukai was more or less unknown to the masses until 2004 wherein Kodansha officially published it. From then on, it went on to become a runaway hit and subsequently got the anime adaptation that it duly deserved to have. All the credits go to Kinoko Nasu and his hard work which is evident in the novel. This was the first work that I read in the much famed Nasuverse  and his collection of novels, games etc and it truly was a memorable one. \n\r\nFor those who might be interested in reading/watching KnK in the correct, chronological order, 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 is the correct order based on the timelines. \r\nAn extra novel which is a sequel to the KnK series is Kara no Kyoukai - Mirai Fukuin. This too was a nice read and one to watch out for. My personal recommendation would be that, in order to have a good understanding of the story, the novel could be read first and then the films could be watched next. It can be done the other way around also so as to check if the films missed out on anything from the novels. Also, definitely do not miss out on watching the films because, everything about the films oozes with top quality. Be it the animation, the background score or the voice acting, everything has been crafted in such a way that it becomes difficult to detest this franchise.\n\n\r\nOne of the man trademark Aozaki Touko quotes:\r\nIt's a mistake to choose your path based upon the sins that you carry. We don't choose our path based on the sins that we carry, but we must bear our sins on the path we choose.\n\n\r\nOverall: 9/10.""]"
133,['Ping Pong'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/5744/Ping_Pong,"['""I\'m sure you\'ll understand too, someday. The melancholy of winning. The pain of praise. The weight on your shoulders... the loneliness and agony. The time will come where your efforts will seem meaningless and your victories empty.""\n\r\nLike much of Taiyo Matsumoto\'s work, Ping Pong includes the same level of energy and surprising depth that outshines its basis to the point of sheer brilliance. Ping Pong, contrary to the title, is less a story about table tennis and more a story about the coming of age of two polar opposite individuals. The author uses ping pong as a medium to advance the story and to develop\n                  ...\nthe characters, so well in fact the manga is almost criminally realistic. Ping Pong deals with worldly themes of friendship, affliction and adolescence, not so different from Tekkonkinkreet, the authors previous work, which makes it very down to earth and above all else - believable.\n\r\nThe manga introduces us to Peco, the energetic I-don\'t-care-what-people-think personality, and Smile, the reserved gentleman who would rather lose than make his opponent feel bad. The development of these two main characters is quite the journey. The supporting cast are thankfully there for a lot more than just to provide moral support, and during a ping pong game Taiyo Matsumoto never really attempts to make the readers favour one character over the other, which allows the manga to stay at a realistic and high quality standard. What makes Ping Pong different from most sport manga is the larger focus on the characters as opposed to the game. The rules are not explained, nor do we get any history lessons. Table tennis is there as a foundation for the story and a means of development. Instead of the game fueling the characters, the characters fuel the game.\n\r\nIf you\'ve read anything by Taiyo Matsumoto before then you know to expect nothing less than absolutely superb art that gives off a level of energy like no other. Matsumoto\'s art is very unique - his lines are often wobbly, the scale of things can sometimes be unclear and his shading is minimal while his inking is high. You won\'t find many sketchy effects usually associated with manga in Taiyo Matsumoto\'s works either, but what he does offer is something totally fresh and just as interesting - that being outstanding line art. A huge amount of detail is put into every single panel and during the ping pong matches the energy behind his art perfectly catches the nature and pace of the game.\n\r\nGiven the level of content in Ping Pong, which is only five volumes long, it is no wonder why Taiyo Matsumoto\'s series are generally rather short. In only these couple of volumes he presents the reader with a wonderfully fresh coming of age story, accompanied by an extremely exciting backdrop, filled with nerve-impulse boosts and eternal undying instinct to boot, complete with realistic characters sure to leave an impression.\n\r\nTaiyo Matsumoto once said his goal is to combine the powerful and cool feeling of American comics, the intellect of European comics and the lightheartedness of Japanese comics together to create a really tremendous work, and I believe he has achieved such with Ping Pong. You\'ll finish this manga worn out due to the level of content and intensity, but extremely satisfied, knowing you just witnessed something quite special.']"

135,['Tokyo Ghoul'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/33327/Tokyo_Ghoul,"[""At first this manga might not have the most original concept or story. However, the way in which it is executed is excellent. There are no such things as 'black and white' in this manga. \n\r\nEach important character has proper development and significance to the story, and none of them are there just for the sake of them being there, nor are they useless. The characters have realistic personalities, and none of them are just 'good' or 'bad'. Each character is well developed and continue to develop and none of them are completely innocent just like how it is in real life.\n\r\nI appreciated the fact\n                  ...\nthat the characters are like this and this manga understands this perfectly. Characters that may seem shallow at first actually have depth to them.\n\r\nKen Kaneki is by far one of the best developed characters I have had the pleasure of seeing. He is not just the 'nerd' or the 'cool emo badass'. Just like any person in real life, he does have secrets he wants to keep buried and not willing to accept. He has various stages of development that actually makes sense in the situations he is in. His motives and thought process is excellently displayed.\n\r\nAnother good thing is how the manga does not just spoonfeed you the facts. They are foreshadowed with various references to numbers, tarot cards, symbolism and metaphors, but unless you pay attention to what you read you will not notice them and not be able to appreciate the manga in its full glory. I would recommend not just reading the manga just once but at least several times to get what you may have missed.\n\r\nOverall an amazing manga, and the cliffhanger ending was actually the best way to end the first part.""]"
136,['The Fable'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/87844/The_Fable,"['It\'s funny how this works. The Fable\'s subject matter is something that\'d be par for the course in Japanese pop culture of the 60s, the 70s, or even the 80s. But today, in 2022, it feels so out of place it once again becomes a breath of fresh air. There\'s nothing quite like it in the current media landscape, making any meaningful comparison extremely challenging—and, frankly, unneeded: its storytelling accomplishments stand firmly on their own legs.\n\r\nThe Fable\'s premise and narrative style occupy an unlikely middle ground between a classic sitcom and a dead-serious film noir. It tells a story of a pair of elite hitmen\n                  ...\nordered by their boss to retire and try living a normal life as fake brother and sister, strictly forbidden to kill again. Given the obvious difficulties with reintegrating harshly conditioned human weapons back into society, a local yakuza group with ties to their organization is tasked with providing assistance so that the two can kick-start something resembling regular day-to-day life. The operative word there is ""resembling"", because *of course* it\'s not going to work out so easily—both because deeply ingrained habits and mindsets don\'t simply go away in a different environment, and also because circumstances calling for those habits constantly catch up to our heroes. It\'s an ongoing fake-it-till-you-make-it endeavor.\n\r\nThe manga treats this conflict with an astounding amount of thought and respect for its characters\' unusual tribulations. As the result, The Fable\'s comedic writing is viciously funny but almost entirely deadpan in its delivery. There is virtually no witty dialogue or silly gags, no tired pop-culture references or any fan service at all; almost all the laughs are the result of characters so far removed from the norm being exposed to said norm and its vessels—regular people like us. The compelling and occasionally hysterical nature of these social interactions demonstrate truly smart writing in a premise almost completely devoid of complex plot movement, which is a rare but welcome occurrence. Fittingly, it is accompanied by hyper-realistic art that portrays characters to the finest detail of their body language, giving further credibility to visual storytelling. There is a lot of nuance—something I particularly appreciate—but no edginess or pathos commonly plaguing similarly set stories. It\'s remarkably down-to-earth in all the right ways.\n\r\nNeedless to say, the characters themselves are the bread and butter of this story, and it\'s very impressive just how likable they are for how unseemly their background is. Especially considering more than half of the recurring cast are either yakuza or assassins—and make no mistake, they aren\'t some ""heart of gold"" type exceptions that conveniently dodge the associated stigma. They are true to form and function, and the reason they\'re so relatable and fun to follow despite that is a testament to the author\'s ability to give them depth and humanity. They aren\'t ""good"" people by most measures, but they\'re complex, conflicted, and interesting. In a series where morality is largely expressed in the darker shades of grey, this is relayed in a surprisingly comfortable manner, and as I was reading I never felt like I was urged to sympathize with scum or hate the righteous. The characters navigate on their own moral compasses, but it doesn\'t lead to contradictions or confused allegiance. Again, good writing right there.\n\r\nThe Fable, much like its protagonists, appears to be a vestige of a bygone era of romanticizing organized crime and hard-boiled protagonists, an artifact out of time. But under its hood lies a funny and heartwarming tale about people on the dark side of our society dealing with their own weird troubles and trying to keep up with the times; it has a lovable cast, it nails a satisfying ending. If there\'s one point of (perhaps, unfair) criticism I could make, it would be for the manga\'s overall lack of storytelling ambition: this is not the kind of story that you\'ll carry in your heart and mind for years, nor it is likely to affect how you think about the world or your own self. It\'s fully content being only where it wants to be and achieving only what it wants to achieve—but it does so with the skill and integrity of a professional hitman.']"

138,['Fate/Zero'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/3649/Fate_Zero,"[""After hearing that Fate/Zero will be made into anime. I decided to read its novel and in the end I was very impressed with the storyline and the characters in here.\n\r\nThe storyline of Fate/Zero takes place 10 years prior to the events of Fate/stay night. You don't have to play or watch Fate Stay Night first to understand its story but it would be better if you do so because it will give you much more understandings about this novel.\n\r\nFate/Zero is about war between 7 magi in the event named Holy Grail War, in this war each of the magi summon their own servant(the heroic\n                  ...\nspirits) and each servant has his/her own class(saber class, archer class, lancer class, etc). They all have one goal, to obtain the holy grail, a legendary item capable of granting wishes. I will talk more about the story in the enjoyment sector.\n\r\nAs this is a novel I can't write much about the arts, but the pictures that were provided in the novel is successful enough to describe the characters or some events that happened in the stories.\n\r\nThe characters in here is one of the strongest points of this novel, there are many characters appeared in here and each of them has their own agenda/goal. I will only make description about some of the characters that appeared in this series. Well, let's begin :\n\r\nEmiya Kiritsugu without a doubt is one of the sell points of this novel, his personality is completely different compare to his son Shirou(protagonist from F/SN), he never hesitates to use any methods as long as his objective achieved, but although it seems he has cold personality, he has a noble goal,  he is participating in this war because he believe Holy Grail could grant his wish for world peace. \n\r\nAnother interesting character is Kotomine Kirei, a man who ended up participating in this war even though he is a magi killer, he keep questioning about the reason why he participate in this war, and about his goal in life. And last but not least, Saber, one of the icons of this franchise, heroic spirit Arturia, a noble, loyal, and brave heroic spirit with goal to redo her life where someone more suitable and effective would lead Britain in her stead.\n\r\nFor the enjoyment section, I would say that Fate/Zero has high enjoyment value. Reading novel can be a little bit tricky because after all the story will be affected by how you imagine the story that was told. But with some good ways of storytelling this kind of weakness can be overcome and Urobuchi Gen managed to wrap and tell the story in Fate/Zero really well. When you're reading this I could say that you will imagine the scene that happened in here, the character's thought as if you’re watching the anime/manga version of it. The story was told in a really detail manner so you can easily imagine the scene that happened in here.\n\r\nYou can also expect a good story in this novel along with some betrayals, bloody moments, and plot twists in it. Fate/Zero is a story about battle between 7 magi so it's natural if you expect some of good battle moments in here. And I can safely guarantee that Fate/Zero has it. You can check it if you don't believe it ^_-. Overall, for action, fantasy, and supernatural genre Fate/Zero has exceeded my expectations. This is a really good novel and fans of these genres should check out this novel.""]"

After all, Ashirogi Muto make their big breakthrough while still in freaking high school. Granted, Bakuman. doesn\'t shy away from the truth that luck is a critical determinant on the way to publication.

Taking the autobiographic approach, however, it tells a real story of detours, dead ends, and what makes someone slacken or persevere at different points in time. This is not to say that nothing was exaggerated for effect\'s sake. I\'m sure a few things were, but the point remains that Kakukaku Shikajika is not so much an inspirational story as it a truthful account of one woman\'s life as an artist. There is some unpleasantness. It is neither glossed over nor is it over-dramatized. But while events are presented in a matter-of-factly fashion looking back from a more comfortable place, there is still a very tangible sense of embarrassment – shame even – as one reflects the choices of a younger self. The strength of Kakukaku Shikajika lies in its subtle emotionality, that tinge of regret running through the story that reaches a new intensity toward the end.\n\r\nHigashimura Akiko is best known for Kuragehime which received both an anime as well as more recently, a live action adaptation. For Kakukaku Shikajika, she uses her real name Hayashi Akiko to retrace her drawing career beginning with her high school days and ending with the present, fitting some non-linear snippets in here and there. With one year left until graduation, Akiko has it all planned out. The goal is to attend the painting department of a prestigious arts college in Tokyo, make her debut as a shōjo mangaka somewhere along the way, use the earnings to pay off her tuition debt, and, upon college graduation, get married to famous actor Toyokawa Etsushi. What could go wrong, right? Phases of overconfidence, hitting creative blocks, poking fun at the ridiculousness of art school, doubts whether it is ""worth it"", your own as well as that of those around you, the stigma attached to drawing comics – there is a lot in here that the aspiring artists out there should be able to relate to.\n\r\nBut Kakukaku Shikajika also excels at depicting more universal struggles. The pivotal point of the story is the mentee-mentor relationship that forms between the author and Hidaka Kenzō, an eccentric old man who offers art classes in a tiny studio in a small town by the sea. Hard to get to if one does not have a car, Akiko is convinced by a friend that this is the place for her to be if she is serious about getting into arts college. Hidaka-sensei promptly informs an entitled Akiko that her sketches suck. He\'s the kind of man who will chew everyone out regardless of who they are, make them draw the same thing over and over and over until they get it just right, while hitting them with a bamboo sword. Nevertheless, he shows extraordinary acts of kindness from time to time, like when he carries an Akiko feigning sickness to the bus station. It is in retrospect that the author recognizes good motives also behind his strictness, and from resenting what he made her do goes to realizing that not only could he have been a more sympathetic teacher but she, too, could have been a better student. That willingness to think yourself into someone else\'s skin and ability to admit your own shortfalls is one of the most important aspects of maturity and in this regard, this is also a classic coming-of-age tale.\n\r\nGiven Kakukaku Shikajika has been fully translated, the number of people who marked it as completed came as a surprise to me. I\'m writing this in hopes of being able to spark someone\'s interest in the manga, as it\'s one of the most worthwhile ones out there.']"
143,['Mahoutsukai no Yoru'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/26027/Mahoutsukai_no_Yoru,"[""This is a review of the visual novel of Witch on the Holy Night and not of the light novel since its impossible to find the original piece of work.\n\r\nThis is my favorite visual novel of all time and a must read for anyone who loves magic, the fate universe or good stories that may take its time but has an extremely satisfying ending.\n\r\nStory 10\r\nThis is a prequel to Tsukihime Remake about Aozaki Aoko and her starting as a mage and someone trying to take her and Alice's Territory when a boy from the mountains who has never experienced technology interferes with their lives. Although\n                  ...\nthe story feels like the start of a series (which it is if Nasu ever finishes writing it) its slow storytelling eases and invests the reader into the story quite naturally, it invests and introduces characters who have very minor appearances at the start of the game and will impact the story later on. It never feels like the story wastes your time at the start although nothing really happens till around the end of the second chapter where few of the many pieces start to fall into place. The story first peaks at chapter 5 where you get one of the greatest set pieces I've experienced in Japanese media, the OST, tension and pay off is there and if this doesn't pull you into the story then you will probably not like it as it has few action scenes and more of the slower slice of life moments which are pretty funny at times. By the end you will be satisfied and wanting more since this does not close out most plotlines from the story and leaving a lot to be answered in its 2 sequels if they ever happen but nicely wraps itself up as well.\n\r\nArt 10\r\nMost high production visual novels have great art so not much to say here, the characters all look great, have great sprites and CGs. Moving on\n\r\nCharacters 10\r\nSide characters are fun but appear most in the slice of life scenes and don't get much time to shine in the bigger more serious moments, especially someone like Ritsuka and the church characters. A lot of these characters might even be missed out on if you skip extra chapters which are found in the archives which is a downside in my opinion and maybe should of been integrated better into the main story. I'm sure they will have bigger roles in the future though. The main characters are all great though Aozaki is my favorite female character in Japanese media, her struggle to balance her life as mage and student is interesting which brings conflict with her friend and mentor Alice from the mage side and her complicated feelings towards Soujuurou and her school life. Alice learning to accept people and Soujuurou learning about the world outside the mountains and learning about his emotions. The main three have such great chemistry with each other that its the main attraction to the story. The main villain is a spoiler but I will say they are this mysterious character who uses puppets and eventually comes out from the shadows. They are intimidating and have moments to steal the spotlight, wish their side story was implemented into the main story just like the side characters and not left until completion of the story though.\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\r\nI absolutely adored Witch on the Holy Night when it first came out without the voice acting and now it is even better with voice acting. The story is slow but there is some great comedic moments especially with one of the side stories unlocked by completing everything. The action is masterfully crafted and feels extremely satisfying. Your enjoyment though will come from if you can sit through the slower moments and feel rewarded by the set pieces or not. As stated above, if you do not enjoy it by the end of chapter 5 I would recommend stop reading it.\n\r\nOverall this is a masterpiece and Nasu's best work yet (although technically it was his first), great characters, amazing payoff for Tsukihime fans and newcomers. this is an absolute must read although I do wish that the characters and side stories where better integrated than found in the archives.""]"
144,['Glass no Kamen'],https://myanimelist.net/manga/1469/Glass_no_Kamen,"[""Glass mask is one of the best shoujo manga out there. Despite having a common enough shoujo setting, the plot hardly ever falls into any of the comon cliches that shoujo manga often times fall into. The artwork is in a classic 80s style, nothing outstanding, but the mangaka does not skimp on the minor details, and her understanding of common facial expressions is top notch. \r\nWhere Glass Mask really stands out is in the main characters and in the story. We are presented with a main character that is hard not to sympathize with and all the supporting characters and antagonists are really well\n                  ...\nfleshed out and have realistic and human personalities. The plot arc is interesting, each mini-arc has trials in the main  characters confidence and abilities which she eventually solves to our amazment and the amazment of the audiences. The main arc slowly building until half way through where there is an impending crisis. \r\nGlass mask's theme of working hard, having natural talent, and succeeding despite lacking beauty or grace make it one of my favorites and mark it as something that every shoujo fan should at least try.""]"
